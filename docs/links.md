# Useful links

These are some links to pages that I find very useful. Some are pretty
well known, some are pages I've never heard of before finding them after
hours of searching for something very specific. I have not sorted the
links in any way or grouped them yet. I will get to it eventually
(hopefully).

You can also find more useful content on my Kiwix instance:
