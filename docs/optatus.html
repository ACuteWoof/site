      <h1>The Work Against the Donatists - St. Optatus, bishop of Milevis</h1>
      <div>
        This is a work that's available for sale on my store. However, since I
        could not find a properly formatted copy of the book presented neatly,
        I've decided to release my formatting of Roger Pearse's transcription to the
        public.

      <h2 id="transcribers-preface">Transcriber’s Preface</h2>
      <p>Optatus of Milevis wrote his sole surviving work around 370 AD.
      The work was directed against those called by their opponents
      ‘Donatists’, who comprised nearly the entire church of Roman
      Africa and were orthodox in belief and practice. The polemic of
      Optatus is one of our primary sources for the origins of Donatism,
      and was written in response to a book by the Donatist bishop
      Parmenian.</p>
      <p>There may be more than one opinion on the statements of
      Optatus. This writer has witnessed various church splits down the
      years. Two examples may be adduced here.</p>
      <p>In 1982, the Anglican church of St. Aldates had as its rector
      the writer and evangelist Michael Green. A group of people under
      the influence of the charismatic movement felt that God wanted the
      church to move in a particular direction. The church leadership
      did not agree, and in the end this group split off and formed
      their own independent congregation. After the split, which
      involved a good many hurt feelings, Aldates nevertheless offered
      help to the new church, recognised them, assisted them to find a
      place in Oxford and retained links with those involved.</p>
      <p>In 1999, the Anglican bishop of Worcester, Peter Selby, made it
      clear through various press interviews that he was strongly in
      favour of promoting unnatural vice in the clergy, despite an
      agreement among the bishops of the Church of England not to do
      this. The parochial church council of St. John’s, Kidderminster,
      then voted that they could no longer accept the authority of Dr
      Selby as their bishop. In retaliation Mr Selby then sacked the
      clergyman, Charles Raven, demanded he and his congregation get out
      of the church, and threatened to have the priest arrested; and Mr
      Raven was apparently indeed interviewed by the police. The church
      emptied, and a new free church, Christ Church Kidderminster, was
      formed in 2002.</p>
      <p>“Do as you would be done by” is the first principle of
      morality. We should ask which of these two instances shows the
      Spirit of Christ at work. The church is centred on Christ and his
      teaching, or it is nothing. But unless we seek the will of God,
      unless we act in love, we achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>It seems inappropriate for this amateur writer to venture to
      criticise Optatus or the translator who has very generously made
      this text available to us all in English. However splits are
      occurring all the time, and there are lessons to be learned in how
      we deal with them. The instances just quoted may inform our
      attitude to what Optatus tells us.</p>
      <p>A split had occurred in the church in Africa some 60 years
      earlier. During the persecution of the Christians carried out by
      the emperor Diocletian, attempts were made by the state to seize
      church property and books of scripture. Those who cooperated in
      ‘handing over’ these were known as <em>traditores</em> – from
      which we get the English word ‘traitor’. Soon after the end of the
      persecution in 305, a certain Caecilian was consecrated Bishop of
      Carthage by someone who was widely believed to be a
      <em>traditor</em>. The accusation was believed by the overwhelming
      majority of Christians in the province, and it was likewise
      believed that such a consecration must be invalid.</p>
      <p>The African bishops voted that Caecilian should be removed from
      his office; yet he did not vacate the see. A small number of
      people remained with him; everyone else consecrated another man as
      bishop. (In every split of principle, a certain number of people
      tend to remain with the buildings, often because they wish to
      ignore the split, have relatives buried around those buildings, or
      other reasons).</p>
      <p>The African bishops then appealed for help to the new Christian
      emperor, Constantine. With hindsight we can see that this was a
      dreadful mistake; but probably it was less obvious at the time.
      Constantine very properly refused to become involved, but arranged
      for a council of Gallic bishops to examine the matter.</p>
      <p>This Council of Arles pronounced Caecilian innocent. The
      account given by Optatus – how Caecilian boldly, or cynically,
      demanded that ‘proof’ be produced of what a whole province knew –
      may remind some who have argued with atheists of the tactics
      commonly employed to advance that creed. Its apologists routinely
      resort to argument by assertion; when the assertion is
      contradicted, they demand ‘proof’ from their opponent. The naive
      Christian tries to prove his case, knowing that he has evidence
      aplenty; the atheist simply picks holes in any evidence produced,
      so as to create the impression that the matter is open, and so
      ‘wins’ by default without ever offering any evidence for his case.
      Was it so with Caecilian?</p>
      <p>Caecilian then gave further proof of the manner of man he was.
      He arranged for the persecution of the other Christians by the
      state. The same soldiers that had looted and murdered at the
      command of Diocletian were ordered into action at the behest of
      the Bishop of Carthage.</p>
      <p>What statements, agreed by all sides, do we have about
      Caecilian?</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Almost everyone in the province believed that he was
      consecrated by a traitor.</p></li>
      <li><p>He held onto consecration despite his poor reputation in
      the community.</p></li>
      <li><p>He preferred to remain bishop, and allow a schism centred
      around him personally rather than resign.</p></li>
      <li><p>He organised the first church-led persecution in
      history.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Is it really possible to say that Caecilian knew Jesus; or that
      he was not just a self-serving timeserver, of the kind that has
      become drearily familiar in subsequent centuries? Or are our
      sources too tangled by accusation and counter-accusation for us to
      certainly know?</p>
      <p>But what if the Donatists were right? What does a believer do,
      when this situation arises? When a wicked bishop is enthroned, the
      laity and junior clergy are placed in a very difficult position.
      In a sense, they have nowhere to go. The laity can silently desert
      the churches. After the restoration of Charles II, when the
      bishops were of this kind, the diarist Samuel Pepys reports the
      steady emptying of the churches. He also reports the venom of the
      bishops and their rage against the non-conformist congregations.
      Like Caecilian, the wicked bishop is eager to unsheath the sword.
      The junior clergy can only resign or endure victimisation. Another
      Anglican bishop demanded a personal oath of obedience from a
      clergyman.</p>
      <p>It is a curious characteristic of these situations, that other
      bishops do not come to the aid of the sheep. Episcopacy, it seems,
      is thicker than the body and blood of Christ. What are the laity
      and junior clergy to do?</p>
      <p>These questions confronted the African Christians in the early
      4th century. They rallied around a new bishop, Majorinus, and
      after his death around his successor, Donatus. The bishops
      elsewhere had failed them. Those who have seen how church politics
      operate in the 21st century may reasonably question whether
      Caecilian had nobbled the Council of Arles, and likewise claimed
      the right to run his diocese by himself. At all events, he
      remained unchallenged, and the schism was soon reinforced by
      persecution. This in turn produced resentment, and then
      retaliation. The hand of the devil in all this is easy to see!</p>
      <p>It is not easy at this distance to see why the schism was not
      settled. After all, the Donatists were orthodox. They were quite
      willing to appoint an outsider as their bishop, so long as he was
      not a scumbag. Optatus tells us that Parmenian was not an African.
      If the bishop is tainted, why could not a man of undoubted
      holiness be appointed, if not immediately then on his death? Was
      there really no candidate that would have been acceptable to Rome
      and the Donatists? Was this never tried?</p>
      <p>As time went by, the schism grew more entrenched, and parallel
      organisations were set up. Yet never the Donatist case never seems
      to have been seriously engaged with. The objection was one of
      principle; the retort one of ecclesiastical administration. The
      schism was to outlast the empire, and to cease only with the
      destruction of the church in North Africa. Dossiers of letters
      were produced in proof of one side or the other; accusations of
      forgery quickly accompanied them.</p>
      <p>It is hard for this writer to address the points that Optatus
      makes without making comparisons. Daily there are reports of
      sodomising bishops persecuting believers in the Episcopal Church
      of the USA, seizing churches, initiating lawsuits for property,
      locking out worshippers, arranging for congregations in exile to
      be expelled from their borrowed buildings and unfrocking clergy
      who dare to place their trust in Christ. Here too the supposedly
      orthodox bishops seem to make no provision to aid the sheep, while
      enjoying the salaries and social esteem. We might ask why each
      congregation is left to fight its own battle, parish by parish?
      Here and there signs of a desire to fight back, to retaliate, of
      anger and frustration can be seen. No doubt in due course some
      will despair, and ask why God does not defend the faithful from
      the wolves; and thus Satan’s purpose in installing these wicked
      men is gratified. A Donatist would find much to sympathise with.
      But would Optatus?</p>
      <p>Many who read Optatus will be thus somewhat unconvinced by his
      arguments. Some of the arguments against the Donatists often seem
      to involve further atheist-type arguments. Never is the issue of
      principle at the root of things addressed. Instead another tactic
      is used. Many a dishonest writer has projected his own vices and
      misdeeds, and accused his opponent of them, not because it is true
      but to try to get them on the defensive and to cover up his own
      misdeeds. The apologists of Caecilian blandly accuse the first
      Donatist leaders also of being <em>traditores</em>. Well, it’s a
      useful tactic, if you don’t mind being a liar. There’s no evidence
      of this, other than the unsupported assertion, and it is
      irrelevant to Caecilian personally being the root of the schism.
      The Donatist complaint of murderous persecution is met with a
      calculated <em>tu quoque</em>, vague but no doubt referring to the
      banditry that was carried out in the name of Donatism, once the
      schism had taken hold. Of course if the Donatists can be accused
      of doing something wrong, then does that excuse any amount of
      bloodshed? And so on. Optatus is the heir to all this, and many of
      the arguments he has read and repeats seem to have been
      manufactured in this way.</p>
      <p>Much of what Optatus writes grates on some minds. The church
      organisation comes first; the question of right or wrong is barely
      discussed, and treated as unimportant. The clergy deserve special
      treatment. In short, we are firmly in the mindset of the medieval
      church, not the New Testament. To any who have witnessed the abuse
      of episcopal power to stifle objections of principle, Optatus will
      be exceedingly hard to read, as he attacks people who only sought
      to have an upright church, and defends the involvement of the
      police in oppressive action.</p>
      <p>What can be said in defence of this? Well, it is entirely
      possible to misread the situation. Optatus, after all, is
      defending a tiny minority against a book written to attack them.
      This minority is threatened by popular violence, and dependent on
      the aid of a not very helpful secular power to keep the knives of
      the circumcellion bandits, allegedly in ‘defence’ of Donatism,
      from their throats. Much may be forgiven a man who is on the
      defensive; is this, perhaps, the situation in which Optatus
      writes? It’s hard to see that a Donatist would be impressed by
      this book; is it perhaps written to bolster the confidence of the
      anti-Donatist, rather than as a piece intended to persuade? We may
      see state power oppressing a principled minority in the service of
      timeservers, and such things are indeed worthy of condemnation.
      But we should consider the possibility that, without hindsight,
      the situation looked different on the ground. Optatus could not
      foresee the burning of Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley, a thousand
      years later, however straight the line may seem to some from the
      position he takes up to the evils of the inquisition and the
      persecution of the faithful by a nominally Christian
      episcopate.</p>
      <p>Every organisation is entitled to self-definition. It is
      likewise entitled to expel those who do not share its values, and
      to remove any of its officials who should fall out of sympathy
      with its aims and objectives. If a church provides a congregation
      with a building, and that congregation and its minister
      apostasise, then it is surely reasonable to expect the property to
      revert to the church. Conversely if those heretics built that
      building themselves, common justice suggests that to expel them
      from it by means of legal maneuvering is theft. The same applies
      in each case when a Christian congregation finds that the church
      has apostasised. There is no special ecclesiastical principle
      involved; merely the ordinary principles of common justice and
      fair-dealing.</p>
      <p>But it is hard to be neutral on these arguments today, with the
      sound of persecution in the air. Let those who can obtain blessing
      from Optatus do so. Let us take away from the whole experience the
      importance of being faithful to Christ, awareness that the Devil
      delights in creating these situations in order to drive believers
      to despair. He is the Prince of this world, and God allows him to
      do as he will, for a little time. Yet in the end it is all about
      people. Church buildings will crumble. But human beings live
      forever. Do unto others, as you would have them do to you. Don’t
      curse them if they fail to treat you so: rather love your enemies,
      do good to those who persecute you. If they steal the churches you
      built with your own sweat and labour, let them have a donation
      also. For these men, wicked as they are, are but dupes of Satan,
      and they too have souls to lose.</p>

      <p>The translation that follows appears to have been made by a
      Roman Catholic who wrote with Anglo-Catholics in mind. Much of
      what it contains, in the very lengthy footnotes, will strike most
      modern Christians as curious. Is it really the case that the
      translator thought that no issue of principle should override the
      opinion of the Pope? Or that no Pope had ever erred? Will modern
      readers really consider it a condemnation of Donatism, that the
      Donatists made the same protests against corrupt ecclesiastical
      abuse of power as the Puritans and Covenanters? But most likely we
      are in danger of misunderstanding, through being in a very
      different situation.</p>

      <h2 id="translators-preface">Translator’s Preface</h2>
      <p>St. Optatus, Bishop of Milevis in Africa, is perhaps the least
      known of all the Fathers of the Church. His treatise against the
      Donatists—the one work that he left to posterity, was translated
      into French in 1564.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is extremely
      improbable that, but for this exception, it has, until now, ever
      appeared in any language save Latin. It is quite certain that it
      has never yet been clothed in an English dress. There is indeed an
      advertisement still to be seen in <em>The Oxford Library of the
      Fathers,</em> in which it was announced (in 1848) that a
      translation of St. Optatus into English would ‘soon’ appear.
      Sixty-eight years have elapsed; but this intention has not yet
      been carried into execution.</p>
      <p>Until recently St. Optatus could hardly be found, even in the
      original Latin, anywhere but in the edition published by Du Pin at
      Antwerp in 1702, and subsequently incorporated by Migne. His work
      was until 1870 out of the reach of all persons who had not access
      to the largest libraries. In 1870—it is true—Fr. Hurter, S.J.,
      published Du Pin’s text in convenient form with short notes,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and in 1893 a new critical
      edition was brought out (edited by the late Professor Ziwsa) in
      the <em>Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum,</em> which has now for
      many years been in course of publication at Vienna. Comparatively
      few people, however, have heard of this excellent edition of the
      Latin Fathers; still fewer are aware that its volumes may be
      purchased separately, and that for the sum of a few shillings they
      may possess themselves of ‘the Seven Books of St. Optatus
      concerning the Schism of the Donatists, against Parmenian.’</p>
      <p>Indeed it is not too much to say that the very name of Optatus
      is barely known even to many students of theology and
      ecclesiastical history. Yet his is no mean name, and he cannot be
      ignored with safety, for he has bequeathed to the Church material
      of no small value, both to the theologian and the ecclesiastical
      historian. Optatus was held in high repute by the great Augustine,
      upon whom his influence was undoubtedly considerable. To this
      Harnack bears witness: ‘Even when he entered into the Donatist
      controversy, Augustine did so as a man of the second or indeed the
      third generation. He therefore enjoyed the great advantage of
      having at his disposal a fund of conceptions and ideas already
      collected. In this sphere Optatus especially had worked before
      him.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      <p>The work of St. Optatus is, therefore, of consequence not only
      from the point of view of history—he is <em>the</em> historian of
      Donatism in its origins—but also from that of doctrine—of
      ‘conceptions and ideas.’ It derives special importance from the
      fact that here we find the first sustained argument from the
      Catholic side not merely against heresy (false doctrine) but also
      against schism (separation from the Church).</p>
      <p>Heresies come and go. They are essentially ephemeral, according
      to some transitory fashion of mental speculation. And in fact
      history proves that the limit of their duration is hardly known to
      last four centuries. Often indeed they pass into all but complete
      oblivion. Thus it comes about that a long and sometimes weary
      discussion concerning a heresy which has perhaps long since
      vanished from the midst of men is apt to lose much of its
      actuality.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> But the Church dies not, and
      in every age excuses are found by the rebellious for their
      rebellion against her supreme authority. The argument against
      heresy is necessarily specialised and multiform; the argument
      against schism is very simple and admits of no substantial
      variation in its presentment.</p>
      <p>Consequently, it never ceases to be of deep interest to follow
      the reasoning that has been employed by the champions of the
      Catholic Church, at any period of her history, on behalf of her
      exclusive and peremptory claim upon the spiritual allegiance of
      mankind. Whenever this is in discussion, there is no drowsy
      stirring of dead bones, but an issue which is ever-living and
      therefore in a certain sense ever-new. Now, upon this subject
      Optatus is perfectly explicit. Again and again he lays it down
      that there is but one true Church of Christ,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that she is not merely local,
      but is scattered all over the world,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> her chief rulers bound
      together by formal bonds and proofs of union, each with his
      fellow,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and above all with the Bishop
      of Rome, Peter’s successor.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
      <p>In other words for Optatus the one question of paramount
      importance is: ‘Which and where is the One Church?’<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> And to this question his
      answer is clear-cut and unmistakable in its import. The Church of
      Christ may be easily recognised by all those who will look for her
      marks. She and she alone is One; she and she alone is truly
      Catholic. In fact this is her name—<em>Catholica</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> She alone is
      Apostolic—Apostolic for this reason, that all over the world
      (‘ubique’) her children are in communion with the <em>Cathedra
      Petri</em>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> the See of that Apostle to
      whom alone the Lord promised the keys of the kingdom of Heaven <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> —the See ‘against which to
      contend is sacrilege.’ <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
      <p>And because Parmenian, his Donatist adversary, had failed to
      recognise ‘where is the Church?’ he is said by Optatus to have
      ‘made confusion of everything.’ <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
      <p>The clearness and decisiveness of the teaching of St. Optatus
      on the Church have caused Harnack to write thus: ‘In this thought
      (of the Church as an institution) Catholicism was first complete .
      . . But Augustine was not the first to declare it; he rather
      received it from tradition. The first representative of the new
      conception known to us, and Augustine also knew him, was Optatus.’
      <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
      <p>It is hardly necessary to observe that this ‘conception’ was
      never really ‘new’ in Christendom. Optatus did not invent it. He
      had ‘received it’ (in the same way that before him in Africa
      Cyprian had already ‘received it,’ and, as Harnack admits,
      Augustine ‘received it) from tradition.’ He ‘received it’ also
      from the express words of Christ and from the prophecies of the
      Old Testament.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> It is, however, perfectly
      true to say that St. Optatus is the first writer known to us who
      sets out in detail the Catholic conception of the one true Church
      of Christ. The opportunity came to him only with the Donatist
      schism. It will always be the great merit of Optatus to have
      seized that opportunity and to have availed himself of it to such
      an extent, that Augustine had but to broaden it out and illustrate
      it with his matchless genius. St. Augustine had only to fill in
      the picture which St. Optatus had already drawn in clear outline.
      To the end of time the Catholic theologian, preacher or
      controversialist, desirous of showing the true nature of the
      Church, and the obligation (binding everywhere, always, upon all
      persons, and under all conceivable circumstances) of living within
      her visible unity, will find everything that he needs ready to Ms
      hand, in the writings of St. Optatus. Moreover, Optatus will
      remind us that from this obligation— strict though it be in
      itself—ignorance (that ignorance which we now call ‘invincible’)
      will excuse its victims.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Ignorance could
      not be pleaded by Parmenian; it was therefore impossible to hold
      him guiltless. But Optatus was evidently aware that in his day in
      Africa (as in our day in England) there were Christians who,
      through no fault of their own, knew nothing of the claims of the
      Chair of Peter.</p>
      <p>Apart from the constitution and marks of the Church, there is
      only one specific doctrine—that Baptism may not lawfully be
      repeated after it has once been validly administered (the
      <em>Credo unum Baptisma</em> of the Creed)—with which St. Optatus
      was <em>directly</em> concerned in his controversy with his
      Donatist adversaries. His statements as to other Truths of Faith
      (denied in later ages) are only by the way, and are generally
      incidental to the course of his historical narrative. This, it
      seems important to observe, gives them an even greater polemical
      value than would have been theirs had Optatus written
      controversially on these subjects, and been contradicted by
      Donatists or any other Christians then living. But this is far
      from being the case. For example, St. Optatus is able to write to
      his opponent: ‘Bene revocasti Claves ad Petrum.’ <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Similarly, with regard to all
      the other Catholic doctrines to which he makes reference
      throughout his work, it is quite clear that he and Parmenian are
      standing on common ground, and were perfectly agreed.</p>
      <p>When then we reflect that St. Optatus wrote in the century
      preceding the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, in the very heart
      of what are sometimes known as ‘Primitive Times,’ when we remember
      that he was anterior to Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome and Leo the
      Great, when we recall the fact that the Reformation in Germany and
      England does not yet go back four hundred years, but that Optatus
      wrote six centuries before the Norman set foot on our English
      soil, and that some thousand years and then two hundred more were
      to elapse between the writings of Optatus and the breach with Rome
      over King Henry’s divorce, it is a most striking and moving fact
      that this old Father of the Church bears his express and
      unequivocal witness not only to the necessity of union with the
      <em>Cathedra Petri,</em> but also to most of those Catholic
      Doctrines so violently assailed in the days of Luther, Calvin,
      Zwingli, Cranmer, Knox and their associates, and still denied on
      all sides around us.</p>
      <p>For example, St. Optatus affirms explicitly the truth of
      Baptismal Regeneration <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>; again and again
      makes reference to the Sacrifice of the Altar <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>; states the doctrine of the
      Real Presence in words that are incapable of any misunderstanding
      <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>; insists on the sacredness of
      the Holy Chrism <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>; writes of the adornment of
      altars for the offering of the Sacrifice <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>; refers to the ceremony of
      Exorcism before Baptism <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>; appeals to
      deutero-canonical Books as to authentic Scripture <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>; takes the continuance of
      Miracles in the Church for granted <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>; and is quite express in his
      references to cloistered Virginity and the difference between the
      Commandments of God and Counsels of Perfection. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Sometimes indeed he is so
      modern in his expressions (or at least his words are so directly
      applicable to our modern circumstances) that when we first read
      them we rub our eyes and ask ourselves ‘Can it be a Catholic
      writer of the fourth century, whom we are reading, not one of the
      twentieth?’ Instances of this may be found in the famous
      description of the origin of the Donatist schism,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> which, as Cardinal Wiseman
      has pointed out,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> can be paralleled with
      startling exactness by the schism under Henry; or again in such
      isolated expressions as ‘<em>Cathedra ducit ad se Angelum,’</em>
      which is all that we need should it be urged that it is safe to
      remain in Anglicanism, because of the (supposed) validity of
      Anglican Orders. If these Orders were ever so valid, they could
      not be more valid than were those of the Donatists; but St.
      Optatus teaches us that, by themselves, valid Orders are of no
      avail. It is useless to have a Bishop <em>(Angelus)</em> who is
      out of communion with that One Chair of Peter, of which Optatus is
      at the time writing. Orders he may have, still he remains visibly
      in schism. <em>Cathedra ducit ad se Angelum</em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Or, similarly, ’Per Cathedram
      Petri, quae nostra est, <em>per ipsam</em> et ceteras dotes apud
      nos esse probatum est.’ <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> It is
      <em>through</em> the Chair of Peter—through our Union with that
      Chair which itself ‘is ours,’ that we derive and can prove our
      security as to the other Endowments of the Church, amongst which
      is reckoned lawful Episcopacy. Or, again, in discussion with any
      Protestant, what need we say more than those three words of St.
      Optatus—‘<em>Catholica prior est</em>’ <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>? Before any Protestant body
      had its birth, before Luther’s turbulent spirit began to trouble
      the peace of Christendom, before the ecclesiastical Provinces of
      Canterbury and York were torn away by the State from their union
      with the Apostolic See, before the ambition of Photius separated
      Byzantium from the elder Rome, before Donatism arose, there was
      the Catholic Church and the Chair of Peter. <em>Catholica prior
      est.</em></p>
      <p>It is beyond doubt that, as Vincent of Lerins taught in the
      fifth century, and as Catholic theologians have since taught in
      every age, there must be a certain development of doctrine in the
      Church—that is to say, an ‘explication’ or unfolding, more and
      more explicit as the years pass on, of that which has always been
      implicit in the Deposit of the Faith delivered in the beginning to
      the Saints; for, where there is life, there must also be growth.
      Yet, whilst studying St. Optatus I have asked myself whether
      <em>since his day</em> there has been room for any <em>real</em>
      development. Whatever development of <em>doctrine</em> may have
      been necessary, at least with regard to the doctrines concerning
      the Holy See and the Eucharist, seems to me, as I read Optatus, to
      have already taken place and to be generally well known and
      accepted throughout the Church.</p>
      <p>The work, then, of St. Optatus derives its great doctrinal
      importance from its unambiguous teaching, principally indeed as to
      the marks of the Church, but also concerning other revealed
      truths, unhappily denied in modern times by great bodies of
      Christians separated from the Catholic Unity.</p>
      <p>There are two subjects, the treatment of which by St. Optatus
      will probably jar upon the sensibilities of most, if not all,
      modern readers: the first is religious persecution, and the second
      the application of certain passages in the Old Testament, in
      minute and even verbal detail, to the controversies of his
      day.</p>
      <p>With regard to persecution, the Donatists continually upbraided
      the Catholics with the punishments inflicted upon their fathers by
      Macarius and Leontius and other officers sent by the Emperors to
      secure religious unity. Now, the reply of St. Optatus up to a
      point is curiously similar to that which we make to-day when we
      are reminded of what happened in England under Mary Tudor. St.
      Optatus urged in the first place that these punishments had been
      greatly exaggerated (just as we say when confronted with Foxe’s
      ‘Book of Martyrs’). In the second place he pointed out (as we do)
      that those who were punished were for the most part turbulent
      conspirators against the public security, and that their treatment
      of Catholics had been infinitely worse than any reprisals to which
      it may have led. Thirdly he laid stress upon the fact (and here
      again we take precisely the same ground) that whatever happened
      came to pass by the authority of the State, and not by that of the
      Church, and that the Church was in no way responsible. If he had
      stopped here, all would have been well, but unfortunately St.
      Optatus went further, and argued that ‘perchance’ the sufferings
      of the Donatists were ‘by the will of God,’ and endeavoured to
      justify them by several parallels from the Old Testament. This is,
      it seems to us, exceedingly regrettable, but we must remember that
      to Optatus, it was an axiom, and as such seemed a truism which no
      man would or could dispute, that it was the duty of a Christian
      State to secure the observance of the true religion, and to punish
      not only offences against society, but also those against Almighty
      God. The modern distinction, so clear to us, between ‘crime’ and
      ‘sin’ was utterly unknown to him, and no doubt, if it had been
      stated in his hearing, would have seemed to him—at least in the
      case of a Christian State—utterly immoral and involving the
      gravest dereliction of duty on the part of a Christian ruler. We
      know from his own letters that it so appeared to Constantine.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> When this fact is grasped, it
      will be more easy to understand a point of view, which is
      inapplicable to any set of circumstances that can be imagined as
      arising in modern times. All that can be said fairly on this
      subject, even by those who think St. Optatus most mistaken and
      wrong, is that unfortunately he was not ahead of his age.</p>
      <p>But it is not only with reference to the punishment of
      schismatics that the appeal of St. Optatus to the Old Testament
      will strike us as strange and sometimes even perverse. Again and
      again, when arguing against some Donatist custom or personage, he
      quotes a passage from Ezekiel, or Daniel, or Isaiah, as though
      Donatus the Great or the sacrileges of his followers had been
      before the mind of the Hebrew Prophet. This to us (at least to
      me)—however ingenious it may sometimes be—is tiresome and
      irritating in the extreme. But we must remember that of course St.
      Optatus did not think or mean anything of the kind. What he did
      mean was that Almighty God, when inspiring His Prophet, intended
      that Prophet’s words to be applied (amongst other ways) to the
      case of the Donatists. All the Fathers of the time (indeed all
      Christians) held a theory of verbal dictation of the inspired
      writings, which has never been taught officially by the Church and
      has long been practically unknown amongst Catholics. Moreover, in
      the fourth and fifth centuries it was generally believed that Holy
      Scripture had many senses in addition to the literal or first
      sense. Consequently all ecclesiastical writers during those
      centuries used the text of Scripture from time to time in a way
      that will inevitably seem to us to be most far-fetched and unreal.
      But if this treatment of the Bible so appears to us, it would not
      have thus appeared to the contemporaries of Optatus. Indeed it is
      highly probable that many Donatists were much impressed and even
      converted by his appeal against them couched in the very words of
      some great Hebrew Prophet. And if St. Optatus is sometimes
      insulting to the Donatists in his application of Holy Scripture,
      it is clear that often—this is certainly true of the <em>muscae
      moriturae</em> in Book VII and of all the passages dealt with in
      Book IV—he is merely retorting arguments that had been used
      against Catholics by Parmenian or other Donatists. Evidently, it
      did not seem to him safe to leave those arguments, so far as they
      consisted of quotations from Scripture, to answer themselves, and
      St. Optatus knew, as we cannot possibly know, the mentality of
      those men of his own day, for whose sake he was writing his
      work.</p>
      <p>However, such an exegesis of Scripture is so alien to our
      habits of thought that it may draw the attention of the reader
      away from the real and great excellences of Optatus to a sense of
      mere annoyance at what will seem to be now and again his
      perversity of interpretation. (In fairness it should be said that,
      so far as this is true of Optatus, it is true also often of St.
      Ambrose and sometimes even of St. Augustine.) In my anxiety that
      there should be nothing to hinder the study of the really
      important and interesting parts of the work of St. Optatus, I
      thought for a moment of excluding his applications of the Old
      Testament to the circumstances of the Donatist schism. But a very
      little consideration made me see that such a course was out of the
      question, and that if I translated St. Optatus at all I must
      translate every word, so that it would be impossible for anyone to
      think that Optatus had been bowdlerised or mutilated at my hands.
      He is great enough to be read in his entirety and reckoned with as
      a whole. The reader may be certain that I have translated—for him
      to read, if he likes—everything without exception as it stands in
      the Seven Books of Optatus, as he submitted them to the judgement
      of his own time.</p>
      <p>St. Optatus can often be usefully illustrated from St. Cyprian
      and St. Augustine; occasionally from St. Jerome and Tertullian. I
      am aware that I have laid myself open to criticism by sometimes
      supplying references to the writings of these Fathers in their
      original; sometimes in a translation. I can but explain that
      considerations of space made it impossible to give them both in
      Latin and English. It only remained to do what seemed to me the
      more useful in each case. Sometimes I thought it safer to
      sacrifice the vernacular for the sake of giving the exact words of
      my authority (after all my footnotes are hardly likely to be read
      by many persons without a knowledge of Latin); sometimes, however,
      I felt it important to give the quotation in a form which all can
      understand. I can only plead that I have exercised my judgement to
      the best of my ability, and have always translated with
      faithfulness.</p>
      <p>I much wished to present the Latin text. But that could not
      have been done without doubling the size and expense of my book. I
      have, however, always given the Latin in a note in three cases:
      (1) when any controversial point was involved, (2) when there was
      any doubt lingering in my mind as to the exact meaning of my
      author, (3) when I thought that my English version was somewhat
      free.</p>
      <p>St. Optatus is by no means easy to translate. His sentences are
      often very long and involved. Not seldom he loses his thread and
      <em>anacolutha</em> are frequent. Often too he is very crabbed and
      obscure. I have been most anxious, and I hope careful, to observe
      the two golden rules of faithful translation: firstly, to put
      <em>no</em> idea in the rendering which is not clearly in the
      text, and secondly to express <em>every</em> thought and phrase of
      the author in words that are as nearly as one can make them the
      equivalent of his own. To secure these two points I have never
      hesitated, when necessary, to sacrifice idiomatic English to
      literalness in translation. Few things are more exasperating than
      is a French paraphrase, which so often is as misleading with
      regard to the exact sense of its supposed original, as it is
      charming in its own beauty and delicacy of expression. The style
      of Optatus is often majestic, always full of force and vigour, and
      sometimes rises to heights of real eloquence. There is one
      peculiarity of the African Latin of the time which, until we are
      accustomed to it, creates a difficulty and therefore perhaps here
      requires a word of notice. It is not too much to say that Optatus
      had no idea of the sequence of tenses observed by the classical
      authors, or even of any distinction in meaning between the
      imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive. This is often noticeable in
      St. Augustine, but even more so in St. Optatus. Optatus uses these
      tenses quite indifferently and often linked together in the same
      sentence, without any reference to the question of time. On the
      other hand, his Latin is often most musical; he had a very
      sensitive ear for rhythm and euphony (it is often a delight to
      read aloud his sonorous sentences for the very joy of listening to
      their sound), and accordingly he will use the pluperfect
      subjunctive where we should expect the imperfect, merely because
      of the cadence. If <em>proposuisset</em> will finish a sentence
      more imposingly and rhythmically than <em>proponeret,
      proposuisset</em> will inevitably fall from his pen. Our only
      guide, as to whether it should be translated ‘he would propose’ or
      ‘he would have proposed,’ is the sense of the context. As soon as
      we have become at all conversant with the writings of St. Optatus
      we shall be accustomed to this peculiarity, and it ceases to
      trouble us. It might well be otherwise with anyone who has never
      read the original. He would naturally be much surprised to see a
      Latin imperfect given in a note, but translated in the text by an
      English verb in the pluperfect, or <em>vice versa.</em> For this
      reason I have thought it well to give this explanation in
      advance.</p>
      <p>It remains to say a few words about the occasion of this
      treatise and its date; we must also state what is known of Optatus
      and of Parmenian, the Donatist, to whom these Books are
      addressed.</p>
      <p>St. Optatus himself tells us the origin of his work.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As the Donatists at the time
      refused a conference or public discussion with Catholics, it
      seemed desirable to answer them in writing. Accordingly Optatus
      determined to reply to a book which had recently appeared, written
      by a certain Parmenian. This Parmenian, about the year 350, had
      become the Donatist Bishop of Carthage, in succession to Donatus,
      the successor of Majorinus, who had commenced all the trouble by
      allowing himself to be intruded into the See already occupied by
      Caecilian, the lawful Catholic Bishop. So we find Optatus writing
      to Parmenian of Majorinus as his <em>avus,</em> and reproaching
      him with sitting in the ‘<em>Cathedra Pestilentiae</em>’ on which
      Majorinus was the first to sit.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Optatus tells us that
      Parmenian was not an African, but a stranger to Carthage.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> Besides the book against the
      Catholic Church which St. Optatus here answers, Parmenian wrote
      another against a fellow-Donatist named Tichorinus, which was, in
      its turn, answered by St. Augustine. Of these two works of
      Parmenian, Du Pin writes in his Preface: ‘Diversa utriusque operis
      divisio, diversus methodus, diversum argumentum, quamquam eadem
      utrobique in Ecclesiam Catholicam convitia legerentur.’</p>
      <p>We are able to gather the date of the work of St. Optatus from
      internal evidence. St. Optatus himself tells us <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> that when he wrote his book
      more than sixty years had elapsed since the storms of persecution
      burst over all Africa. Now, the persecution of Diocletian (which
      without doubt is here referred to) began early in 303 and ceased
      in the East in 305. Again, whilst St. Optatus terms Photinus ‘a
      heretic of this present time,’ <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> St. Jerome tells us that
      Photinus died in the year 376. Putting these two dates—that of the
      cessation of the Diocletian persecution and the death of
      Photinus—together, and bearing the words of Optatus concerning
      them in mind, we gather that he wrote after 365 and before 376.
      But we can narrow it still further, for St. Jerome also tells us
      that Optatus wrote when Valentinian and Valens were Emperors.
      Valentinian was elected Emperor in 372, and died in 375. Between
      these years therefore St. Optatus published the first edition of
      his work. I say <em>the first edition,</em> for the following
      considerations seem to make it certain that he subsequently
      brought out his work anew with considerable additions, directed
      against the cavils with which the Donatists had met its
      publication.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> In the list of Popes <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> we now find the name of
      Siricius given after that of Damasus. But Siricius was not raised
      to the Supreme Pontificate until 384, some years after the death
      of both Valentinian and Valens. It is, therefore, quite certain
      that Optatus could not possibly have written in the lifetime of
      these Emperors, that ‘together with the whole Catholic world’ he
      was then ‘united with Siricius in the bonds of communion.’ <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Moreover, Optatus gives us
      not only a list of the Popes from St. Peter, but also a list of
      the Donatist anti-Popes from Victor Garbensis (the first of the
      series) to Macrobius.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Of this
      Macrobius he writes as of one still living, and calls him the
      <em>socius</em> of Parmenian. Later on, however, in the same
      chapter Optatus gives the names of two obscure anti-Popes,
      Lucianus and Claudianus (otherwise unknown to history), who had
      succeeded Macrobius in the Donatist line. These names, like that
      of Pope Siricius, must necessarily have been added after the work
      had been finished and first given to the world. We may, therefore,
      safely conclude that Optatus wrote his Six Books against Parmenian
      about the year 373, when Valentinian and Valens were Emperors,
      during the Pontificate of Damasus. But he lived on until the time
      when Siricius was Pope and Theodosius Emperor, and then brought
      out a new edition of his work up to date, and no doubt added in
      some shape or other the chapters which now constitute his Seventh
      Book.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
      <p>Concerning the life of St. Optatus hardly anything is known,
      but he has always been held in honour in the Church by reason of
      the tradition concerning the sanctity of his life, as well as the
      vigour and learning with which he defended the Faith. Thus St.
      Fulgentius joins his name with those of Augustine and Ambrose, and
      writes as follows: ‘Sive quod Sanctus Ambrosius, sive quod Sanctus
      Augustinus, sive quod Sanctus Optatus senserunt a nobis quoque
      salva veritate fidei sentiatur.’ <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> St. Augustine too joins
      together St. Ambrose and St. Optatus as authorities, writing,
      ‘doctrinam quam commendavit Milevitanus Optatus vel Mediolanensis
      Ambrosius.’ <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> In another place St.
      Augustine appeals to St. Optatus as the great authority for the
      history of the Donatist schism, and describes him as ‘Venerabilis
      memoriae Milevitanus Episcopus Catholicae Communionis Optatus.’ <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Concerning the accuracy of
      St. Optatus as an historian there has never been any more doubt
      than as to his orthodoxy and learning as a theologian. His work
      was, as he himself tells us and St. Augustine bears witness,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> richly documented and was
      never controverted on any side. Indeed there is an amusing story
      given by St. Augustine and still to be found in the <em>Gesta
      Collationis Carthaginensis</em> as to how the Donatist Bishops
      appealed to his authority concerning Constantine’s refusal to
      allow Caecilian to return immediately to his See, and the way in
      which the laugh was turned against them when the whole passage was
      read aloud.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
      <p>We know from St. Jerome that Optatus was an African by birth,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> and from St. Augustine that
      he was a convert to the Faith. Augustine’s beautiful words on this
      subject may well be quoted; they seem to lose the fragrant
      delicacy of their aroma if any attempt be made to translate them:
      ‘Nonne aspicimus quanto auro et argento et veste sussarcinatus
      exierit de Aegypto Cyprianus Doctor suavissimus et Martyr
      beatissimus; quanto Lactantius, quanto Victorinus, Optatus,
      Hilarius, ut de vivis taceam!’ <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
      <p>Here the names of Optatus, Lactantius and Cyprian are brought
      together—three great African converts—by a fourth, Augustine, the
      greatest of them all. And if, as is undoubted, Augustine, himself
      ‘rich with the spoils of the Egyptians,’ owed much also to
      Optatus, Optatus owed even more to Cyprian. We see the influence
      of St. Cyprian throughout the writings of Optatus, though, like
      Augustine after him, Optatus did not fear to desert Cyprian, where
      (as in the question of the re-baptism of heretics) Cyprian was
      wrong.</p>
      <p>To overestimate the influence of Cyprian on the Church in
      Africa in the fourth century is hardly possible. By his sanctity,
      by his learning, above all by his heroic martyrdom, Cyprian had
      won for himself a position which was unique in the veneration and
      affection of the Faithful. For this reason the works of St.
      Cyprian were continually appealed to by the Donatists. Petilian
      quoted them against St. Augustine, as in the days of Optatus they
      had already been quoted by Parmenian.</p>
      <p>The Canon of Scripture was fixed by Pope St. Damasus whilst St.
      Optatus was very likely still alive, and (whatever we may think of
      the use that Optatus sometimes made of the sacred text) there is
      no doubt of the veneration in which he held the inspired writings.
      On occasion, we must admit, he quoted them with inaccuracy; from
      which it follows that he must have quoted by heart. But he (or
      rather a writer who lived not many years later) tells us that the
      MSS. were numerous in his time and ‘in the hands of all.’ <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Optatus probably knew neither
      Greek nor Hebrew. He employed a pre-Hieronymian version (African
      in form, but less typically so than that used by St. Cyprian), to
      the very words of which (even in the translation) he seems to have
      ascribed inspiration. But surely it is far better to honour the
      text of the Written Word of God too much than too little, and in
      this, as in so many other things, St. Optatus may, if we will, be
      to us, in these days of Modernism, both an example and an
      inspiration.</p>
      <p>Nothing is known as to the exact date or place of his death.
      Throughout Christendom there are magnificent temples raised to the
      honour of Ambrose, Jerome and Augustine; in memory of Cyprian
      there is a famous Chapel in the Catacombs; in no land—so far as I
      have been able to discover—is there even an altar raised to Heaven
      under the invocation of Optatus of Mile vis. For him there is no
      public <em>cultus</em> anywhere amongst the Faithful in the Church
      of God. But he lives in his work—a monument of his zeal for the
      Catholic Faith and for Catholic Unity. No Catholic, having once
      read this book, and having therein entered into the loyal,
      upright, devoted, strenuous, somewhat impetuous spirit of its
      author—a Bishop who threw himself whole-heartedly into the fight
      that he knew to be necessary; a formidable and on occasion
      hard-hitting champion of Religion; a good shepherd who knew not
      guile and hated schism, but loved the Peace which, as he tells us,
      Christ bequeathed as a keepsake to His children; who loved the
      Unity of the Church which alone can secure that Peace for those
      who will seek and ensue it; who loved the Chair of Peter and the
      safety of his flock better far than he loved aught on earth
      beside—but will recognise to the full the justice of the simple
      words of the Roman Martyrology which on the fourth of each
      recurring June commemorate this single-minded servant of God,</p>
      <p><em>Milevi in Numidia Sancti Optati Episcopi doctrina et</em>
      <em>sanctitate conspicui.</em></p>
      <p>‘He being dead yet speaketh.’</p>
      <div class="center">

      </div>
      <p>At least six manuscripts of St. Optatus are in existence (all
      of them in a more or less incomplete state), and were consulted by
      Ziwsa. We shall refer to them as A, B, C, G, P, R,
      respectively.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>A = Orléans, Bibliothèque de la ville, 169 (seventh
      century—only a fragment).</p>
      <p>B = Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 1712, formerly in the
      Library of Baluze, 290 (fourteenth century).</p>
      <p>C = Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 1711, formerly in Colbert’s
      Library (eleventh century).</p>
      <p>G = Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 13335, once in the Library
      of St. Germain-des-Prés, 609 (1248), (fifteenth century).</p>
      <p>P = Petrograd, Imperial Public Library, Lat. 25 Q.v. omd. I. 2
      (fifth or sixth century).</p>
      <p>R = Reims, Bibliothèque de la ville, 221 (olim 138) (beginning
      of ninth century).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Of these manuscripts, P is the most ancient and undoubtedly the
      most valuable. Unfortunately it is extant for the first two Books
      only. For the other Books R is the best authority. Ziwsa, however,
      seems to think that some of the various readings in G may
      represent changes made by St. Optatus himself in his second
      edition; from this point of view (late though it is) G becomes
      very important. A is too fragmentary to be of much service; it is
      extant for the first two chapters of the Seventh Book only. To C
      we owe all that remains of the Appendix; unhappily it commences in
      its present state only about the middle of the Sixth Book. Ziwsa
      holds B in small account, and Du Pin tells us that it is <em>valde
      mendosus.</em></p>
      <p>The <em>Editio Princeps</em> of Optatus was printed at Metz in
      1549 by Cochlaeus, a Canon of Warsaw. He dedicated his book to the
      Abbot of Tongerloo, in the hope that in the splendid library of
      that renowned Abbey some manuscript might be discovered, whereby
      his text might be corrected, since he had at his disposal only a
      MS. of the fifteenth century, full of faults, which is known as
      <em>Codex Cusanus.</em> Ziwsa was unable to examine it. Cochlaeus
      himself says of this <em>Codex</em> that it was ‘ex antiquo codice
      quopiam mendose ab indocto librario scriptum et ab alio deinceps
      multo adhuc mendosius rescriptum.’ Poor material indeed upon which
      to work! The <em>Editio Princeps</em> of Optatus is referred to as
      <em>v.</em></p>
      <p>Fourteen years later, in 1563, a new edition was brought out by
      Francis Balduinus, who tells us that in the edition of Cochlaeus
      there were more mistakes than sentences, at which, under the
      circumstances, we can hardly be surprised. Balduinus had a
      hitherto unknown MS., which was lent him by a Paris theologian, at
      his disposal, but the text was still exceedingly corrupt, until in
      the year 1569 he was able to produce a much better edition, since
      by this time he had access to two new MSS. neither of which is
      available to us. The second of these MSS., known as Codex
      Tilianus, from the name of a Bishop of Meaux to whom it belonged,
      contains the passages in Book VII. which are now generally held to
      be spurious, and which Balduinus was the first to print. He
      brought out yet another edition in 1599. This third edition of
      Balduinus possesses some valuable notes by its author, and is
      quoted as <em>b.</em></p>
      <p>Three more editions were brought out in the next century: the
      first, full of mistakes, prepared by Albaspinaeus, Bishop of
      Orleans, and published after his death in 1631. This same year the
      Anglican scholar Casaubon published in London an edition of
      Optatus, but could only use <em>b,</em> as he was unable to
      consult any manuscripts. This edition, therefore, abounds in
      conjectural emendations, many of them highly ingenious, which,
      apart from any intrinsic probability that they may possess,
      receive importance from the critical acumen and learning of their
      author.</p>
      <p>Yet another edition was published by Priorius in Paris, but it
      is of no value whatsoever. The text is that of the <em>first</em>
      edition of Balduinus.</p>
      <p>We now come to the great work of Du Pin, the famous Gallican
      theologian. Du Pin brought out his edition of Optatus in 1700,
      again at Amsterdam in 1701, and in an improved form at Antwerp in
      1702. He discovered the important MSS CBG, and was thus able to
      make the first serious attempt to restore the correct text of
      Optatus in the many places where it had become corrupt. He added
      notes of his own, and also printed anew those of Casaubon,
      Albaspinaeus, Barthius and Balduinus. He is the author of the
      concise marginal summary of the contents of each chapter, prefixed
      a Preface and a History of the Donatist schism to the text of
      Optatus, and appended many valuable documents in various ways
      illustrative of Donatism, as well as the <em>Gesta Collationis
      Carthaginensis,</em> so far as they exist, in full.</p>
      <p>For nearly two hundred years nothing fresh was done for
      Optatus, until, as we have already stated, at the end of the
      nineteenth century Ziwsa published his critical edition. He had
      the advantage not only of the labours of his predecessors, but
      also for the first two Books he had access to P, which was unknown
      to all of them. Ziwsa gives us the various readings, but was
      precluded by the rule of the Vienna Academy for the <em>Corpus
      Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum</em> from providing other footnotes.
      He has, however, contributed a long Preface, dealing exclusively
      with questions concerning the text, as well as two valuable
      Indices, the first <em>Nominum et Rerum,</em> the second
      <em>Verborum et Locutionum</em> S. <em>Optati.</em></p>
      <p>In my translation I have generally followed Ziwsa’s text, but
      have not been afraid to desert it, if I thought that I saw good
      reason—especially when Ziwsa himself has deserted P. The different
      readings will always be found in a footnote, unless they are of
      absolutely no consequence. I have (as will be seen) freely availed
      myself of the notes furnished by Du Pin, especially of his own and
      of those of Casaubon. But it is strange how often those passages
      in Optatus which seem to me to present most difficulty and have
      caused the greatest uncertainty in my mind as to their precise
      meaning have been left untouched by all the commentators, without
      any explanation whatever.</p>
      <p>In conclusion I must express my deepest sense of obligation to
      Dom John Chapman, O.S.B. With unfailing kindness and generosity he
      has corrected my work throughout, whilst it was yet in manuscript.
      To him I owe numerous suggestions. Without his aid I should never
      have ventured to undertake a task which has been to me a
      delightful labour, full of unexpected interest on every page. My
      hope is that many others may, through this English work, go if
      possible to the Latin, or may, in any case, fall happily under
      that which to me it is no exaggeration to term the spell and
      fascination of St. Optatus of Milevis.</p>

      <p>One Faith,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> most honoured brethren,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> commends <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> us all, who are Christians,
      to the keeping of Almighty God. To this Faith it appertains to
      believe that the Son of God, the Lord,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> shall come to judge the
      world—that He, who has already come, has been born, according to
      His Human Nature, through <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Mary a Virgin,
      that He has suffered, died, and (after having been buried) has
      risen from the grave.</p>
      <p>Also, before ascending to Heaven, whence He had descended,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> He left behind, through His
      Apostles, as His parting gift,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> to all
      Christians, Peace.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> And, lest it
      should seem that to His Apostles only He had left this Peace, He
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘That which I say to you, I say to all.’ <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And He also said:</p>

      <p>‘My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave unto you.’ <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus we see that Peace has been given to all Christians..</p>
      <p>That it is God’s Peace, we know, inasmuch as He says ‘My
      Peace.’ But when He says ‘I give to you,’ we know that He willed
      that it should belong not only to Himself, but to all those as
      well who should believe in Him,</p>

      <p>If this Peace had remained whole and inviolate <a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> as it was given, and had not
      been disturbed by the authors of the schism, there would not be
      any disagreement to-day between us and our brethren, nor would
      they be causing God inconsolable tears (as Isaiah the prophet
      bears witness <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>), nor would they deserve the
      name, and do the deeds, of false prophets <a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>; nor would they have built a
      crumbling and whitened wall <a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>; nor would they
      overturn simple but too credulous minds; nor would they, by

      of all, place upon them the veils of destruction <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>; nor would they speak evil

      the Faithful; nor should we now be grieving for the souls which
      they have either destroyed or slain,—souls of the innocent, for
      whom God was the first to grieve, saying by the mouth of Ezekiel
      the prophet:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Woe to you who place a veil over every head and over every
      age, for the destruction of souls. The souls of My people have

      they proclaim to My people their empty deceits.’ <a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="why-schismatics-should-be-called-brethren.">Why
      Schismatics should be called Brethren.</h3>
      <p>Lest any one should say, that without thought I call them
      brethren, I would reply that such they are, for we cannot escape
      from the words of the prophet Isaiah <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>; and, although they would not
      deny (as all men know well) that they hold us in abhorrence, and
      ban us utterly and are unwilling to be called our brethren,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> still we may not depart from
      the fear of God, for the Holy Spirit exhorts us by Isaiah the
      prophet, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You who fear the Word of the Lord, hear ye the Word of the
      Lord.<br />
      ’To those who detest and curse you, and are unwilling to be called
      your brethren,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> say ye nevertheless:<br />
      ’ “You are our brethren.” ’ <a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>They therefore are without doubt brothers, though not good
      brothers. Wherefore let no one marvel that I term those
      <em>brothers,</em> who are unable to escape being our brethren.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> They and we have one
      spiritual birth, though widely differing is our conduct.</p>
      <p>For even Ham, who mocked undutifully at his father’s shame,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> was the brother of the
      innocent. In accordance with his deserts, he incurred the yoke of
      slavery, so that he—their brother—was assigned in bondage to his
      brethren. From this we see that, even where there is sin, the name
      of brotherhood is not lost.</p>
      <p>Concerning the sins of these our brethren, I will speak in
      another place. For they, sitting over against us, speak <a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> evil things about us.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> They consort with that Thief
      <a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> who robs God, and share their
      lot with adulterers <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> (that is, with
      heretics), and make their sins an object of praise,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a> and plan reproachful words
      against us Catholics.</p>
      <h3 id="why-optatus-thought-it-well-to-undertake-the-task-of-refuting-parmenians-book.">Why
      Optatus thought it well to undertake the task of refuting
      Parmenian’s book.</h3>
      <p>They all—each in his own district—make a great noise with
      wicked words. To some of their statements I may reply when
      opportunity arises.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> But we have
      found only one with whom it is possible to discuss these matters
      either by correspondence, or by the exchange of
      treatises—Parmenian our brother, if indeed he will allow us to
      call him brother. Since they are unwilling to be in communion, as
      we are, with the whole body of Bishops,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> let it be freely granted that
      they are not colleagues, if they refuse so to be, but (as we have
      already said), brothers they are.</p>
      <p>Now, my brother Parmenian, in order that he might not speak
      like the rest, in a windy <a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> and unconvincing
      manner, has not only given utterance to his opinions in speech,
      but has also set them down in writing. Since, then, love of truth
      compels us <a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> to answer what he has said,
      we may still have some sort of conference —even though we cannot
      meet together.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
      <p>By this means also the wishes of certain people will be
      satisfied. For many have often expressed a desire for a public
      discussion between champions drawn from both sides, in order to
      elicit the truth. And this might well have been done. At any rate,
      though the Donatists forbid their people to come to us, and close
      the way to any approach to us, and avoid a meeting,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> and refuse to speak with us,
      let there be a conference, my brother Parmenian, between us two in
      this way, that, as I have not thought little of, nor despised,
      your treatises, which you have wished to be read and quoted by
      many, but on the contrary have patiently listened to everything
      that you have brought forward,—so do you, in your turn, attend to
      the reply which, with humility, I make to you.</p>
      <h3 id="the-nature-of-parmenians-book.">The Nature of Parmenian’s
      book.</h3>
      <p>Now I understand well, and you do not deny,—and every man, who
      is not a fool, will quite plainly see for himself—that you never
      would have written at such a length for any other purpose,
      excepting that you might, by your writings, strike an undeserved
      blow at the Catholic Church. But (as it has been given me to
      discover) whilst your wishes say one thing, your arguments shout
      another. Moreover, I perceive that not all that you have written
      is an argument against Catholicism.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
      <p>Indeed, though you are not a Catholic, what you say often tells
      in favour of the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> Therefore it will only be
      necessary for us to answer you when through wrong information you
      write, not of what you have yourself seen,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> but of what you have heard
      from others speaking falsely (although we have read in the Epistle
      of Peter:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Be ye unwilling to judge your brother without certainty’ <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For instance, amongst other things which have no reference to
      us (that they have no such reference I shall prove), you say that
      we asked for armed troops to be employed against you.</p>
      <p>But in other parts of your treatise there are some things which
      tell in our favour, and against you—such are the analogy of the
      Flood, and that of Circumcision.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
      <p>Some things there are which tell both for us and for you. For
      example, what you have written in praise of Baptism (excepting
      that you have said untrue things concerning the Flesh of Christ)
      tells in your favour <a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a> as well as in
      ours, because, although you are outside, still, from us you went
      forth.</p>
      <p>It would also be in favour of both sides—if you had not joined
      yourselves to those who are certainly schismatics <a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a>—that you have proved that
      heretics are strangers to Catholic Sacraments.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
      <p>Some things are arguments for us alone. Such is your reference
      to the One Church.</p>
      <p>Some things that you have mentioned tell the wrong way for you,
      in consequence of your ignorance, as a foreigner,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> <span>[</span>of the
      facts<span>]</span>—for instance, your indictment of ‘Betrayers’
      <a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a> and schismatics.</p>
      <p>The way in which you have written concerning the Sacraments and
      Sacrifice,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a> offered by one who is in sin,
      also goes against you.</p>
      <p>So, when we investigate, we discover that in reality you have
      brought nothing against us except your mistaken charge, that we
      asked to have troops employed against you. That this is a calumny
      we shall be able to prove to absolute demonstration. Take this
      calumny out of your book, and you are ours.</p>
      <p>For what can be more to our purpose than your argument from the
      fact that there was only one Flood —the type of Baptism? And, in
      maintaining that the one <a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> Circumcision
      availed for the salvation of the people of the Jews, you have
      written in defence of our doctrine, as though you were one of us.
      For this is <em>our</em> argument, who defend the Unity of Baptism
      conferred in <span>[</span>the Name of<span>]</span> the
      Trinity.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a> It is not an argument in
      favour of you, who dare to repeat, against the laws,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> that Baptism, of which the
      one Flood and one Circumcision are typical. And this, although you
      yourselves would not deny that what has been commanded to be done
      once only, ought not to be repeated. But whilst you have praised
      with acuteness that which is worthy of all praise,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> you have by a quibble
      introduced your own persons, as if—since it is only lawful once
      <span>[</span>to baptise<span>]</span>—for you it were lawful, for
      others unlawful.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
      <p>If it be unlawful for Betrayers to baptise, it cannot be lawful
      for you, for we can prove that your first fathers were
      Betrayers.</p>
      <p>If it be unlawful for schismatics to baptise, it must therefore
      be unlawful for you, for you originated the Schism.</p>
      <p>If it be unlawful for sinners to baptise, we can prove from
      divine testimony that you are sinners also.</p>
      <p>Finally, since the validity of Baptism does not depend upon the
      character of the man who has been chosen to baptise, but upon an
      act which lawfully is done but once, for this reason we do not set
      right <a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a> baptisms which have been
      administered by you, because both amongst us and amongst you the
      Sacrament is one.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
      <p>The whole nature of this Sacrament we shall set forth in our
      fifth book.</p>
      <h3 id="the-arguments-set-forth-in-parmenians-treatise.">The
      arguments set forth in Parmenian’s treatise.</h3>
      <p>My brother Parmenian, you have indeed treated of many things,
      but I see that I must not answer you point by point, in the same
      order as that which you have employed. For you have written in the
      first place of the figures and praise of Baptism. Here (with the
      exception of your error concerning the Flesh of Christ) you have
      written well. But this, however, tells in our favour, as we shall
      show in its proper place.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you have maintained that there is only One Church,
      from which heretics are shut out. You have, however, been
      unwilling to recognise where this One Church is to be found.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, you have denounced the ‘Betrayers’ without fixing
      names or describing persons.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, you have attacked the makers of Unity.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
      <p>Fifthly (to pass over matters of but trifling importance), you
      have written about the Sacraments and Sacrifice of a sinner.</p>
      <h3 id="the-division-of-this-work-and-the-contents-of-its-several-books.">The
      division of this work and the contents of its several books.</h3>
      <p>But it seems to me that in the first place the cities,
      positions, and names of the Betrayers and schismatics should be
      pointed out.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> In this way the true authors
      of the crimes, concerning which you have written, may be convicted
      of their certain guilt.</p>
      <p>Secondly,<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a> I shall have to say which is
      the Church, or where is to be found the One Church—which is
      <em>the</em> Church—because, besides the One Church, there is no
      other.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, I shall prove that we did not ask for the troops and
      that what is said to have been done by the makers of Unity does
      not concern us.</p>
      <p>In the fourth place, I shall show who is the sinner whose
      sacrifice God repudiates, or from whose Sacraments <a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> we must flee.</p>
      <p>Fifthly, I shall treat of Baptism; and in the sixth place of
      your ill-considered assumptions and mistakes.</p>
      <h3 id="the-flesh-of-christ-is-not-sinful.">The Flesh of Christ is
      not sinful.</h3>
      <p>But before I say anything of these subjects separately, I shall
      show briefly that you have spoken wrongfully <a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a> of the Flesh of Christ, for
      you have said that the Flesh which was drowned by the floods of
      the Jordan, and was thus cleansed from all stains, was the Flesh
      of Sin. You might have said this with reason if the Baptism of the
      Flesh of Christ had sufficed for all, so that it were not
      necessary for any man to be baptised for himself. Had this been
      so, the whole human family would have been in the Jordan, and all
      that which is born in the flesh would have been there. In that
      case there would have been no difference between the Faithful and
      any one of the heathen, for flesh belongs to them all; and since
      there is no man who is without flesh, if, according to your mode
      of expression, the Flesh of Christ was drowned in the waters of
      the Jordan, the flesh of all men would have gained this benefit.
      But the Flesh of Christ is one thing in Christ—quite another is
      the flesh of each man in himself. What came over you to call the
      Flesh of Christ sinful? Would that you had said ‘the flesh of men
      in the Flesh of Christ.’ But even thus, you would have spoken
      without reason,<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a> since each believer is
      baptised in the Name of Christ, not in the Flesh of Christ, which
      belonged to Himself exclusively. I may add that His Flesh, which
      was conceived by the Holy Ghost, could not be washed, amongst
      others, for the remission of sins, for It was without any sin.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> You have gone on to say that
      It was drowned in the floods of the Jordan.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> This word <em>drowned,</em>
      you have used inadvisedly enough, for it is a word which should be
      used only of Pharaoh and his people, who were so drowned by the
      weight of their offences, as to remain, like lead, beneath the
      waters. But the Flesh of Christ, when It went down into and came
      up from the Jordan, ought not to have been spoken of by you as
      drowned. His Flesh was found to be more holy than the very Jordan,
      so that rather did It cleanse the water by Its entrance, than
      Itself was cleansed.</p>
      <h3 id="mention-of-heretics-made-by-parmenian-to-no-good-purpose.">Mention
      of Heretics made by Parmenian to no good purpose.</h3>
      <p>Moreover, I cannot pass over a matter in which I think you have
      acted craftily. In order that you might lead the minds of your
      readers off the point, or deceive them, after you had described
      Circumcision and the Flood, and after you had praised Baptism, you
      thought fit to raise, as it were from the dead, heretics who were
      already dead and, together with their heresies, buried in
      oblivion—and this although not only their errors, but even their
      names, were unknown throughout Africa—Marcion, Praxeas, Sabellius,
      Valentinus, and the rest up to the Cataphrygae, all of whom were
      confuted in their time by Victorinus of Pettau,<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> by Zephyrinus of Rome,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> by Tertullian of Carthage,
      and by other champions of the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> Why, then, do you wage a war
      with the dead, who have nothing to do with the affairs of our
      time? For no reason, excepting that you, who are a schismatic of
      to-day, having nothing that you can prove against Catholics, have
      been pleased to enumerate so many heretics and their heresies, to
      spin out your somewhat wordy treatise.</p>
      <h3 id="the-distinction-between-heretics-and-schismatics.">The
      distinction between heretics and schismatics.</h3>
      <p>Now there is another question: For what purpose have you
      mentioned those who have not the Sacraments which you and we alike
      possess? <a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a> Sound health does not
      clamour for medicine; strength which is secure in itself does not
      need outside help; truth has no lack of arguments; it is the mark
      of a sick man to seek remedies; it is the sign of a sluggard and a
      weakling to run in search of auxiliaries; it belongs to a liar to
      rake up arguments.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> To return to
      your book, you have said <a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a> that the
      Endowments <a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> of the Church cannot be with
      heretics, and in this you have said rightly,<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> for we know that the
      churches of each of the heretics have no lawful Sacraments, since
      they are adulteresses, without the rights of honest wedlock,<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> and are rejected by Christ,
      who is the Bridegroom of One Church,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> as strangers.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> This He Himself makes clear
      in the Canticle of Canticles. When He praises One,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a> He condemns the others
      because, besides the One which is the true Catholic Church, the
      others amongst the heretics are thought to be churches, but are
      not such.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a> Thus He declares in the
      Canticle of Canticles (as we have already pointed out) that His
      Dove is One, and that <a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> the chosen
      Spouse, and again <a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a> a garden
      enclosed, and a fountain sealed up.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
      <p>Therefore none of the heretics possess either the Keys, which
      Peter alone received,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a> or the Ring,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a> with which we read that the
      Fountain <a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a> has been sealed <a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a>; nor is any heretic one of
      those to whom that Garden belongs in which God plants His young
      trees.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a> Concerning these men, that
      which you have written at length (although it has nothing to do
      with our present business) is abundantly sufficient.</p>
      <p>But to my surprise you have thought good to attach yourselves
      to those who certainly are schismatics, for in denying the
      Endowments of the Church both to those who are heretics, and also
      to schismatics, you have denied them to yourselves.</p>
      <p>Amongst other things you have said that schismatics have been
      cut off, like branches, from the Vine, and that they have been
      reserved, marked off for punishment, like dried wood, for the
      fires of Hell.</p>
      <p>But I see that you do not yet know that the Schism at Carthage
      was begun by your fathers. Search out the beginning of these
      affairs, and you will find that in associating heretics with
      schismatics, you have pronounced judgement against yourselves.</p>
      <p>For it was not Caecilian <a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a> who went forth
      from Majorinus, your father’s father,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> but it was Majorinus who
      deserted Caecilian; nor was it Caecilian who separated himself
      from the Chair of Peter,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> or from the
      Chair of Cyprian <a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a> —but
      Majorinus,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> on whose Chair you sit—a
      Chair which had no existence <a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> before
      Majorinus himself. Since then there can be no possible doubt that
      these things have thus happened, and that you are the heirs of
      Betrayers and schismatics, I am, my brother Parmenian,
      sufficiently surprised—seeing that you are yourself a
      schismatic—that you should have thought it advisable to join
      schismatics to heretics. If, however, these are your principles,
      and you wish to do so, heap up together <a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> what you have laid down only
      a little before. For you have said that ‘It could not be that one
      who was stained should wash away sins in a
      baptism-that-is-not-Baptism,<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a> that one who
      is unclean should cleanse, that one who trips men up <a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a> should raise them, that one
      who is lost should free, that one who is guilty should give
      pardon, that one who has been condemned should absolve.’ <a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
      <p>All these things might well be true of heretics alone, since
      they have falsified the creed,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a> for amongst them one has
      said that there are two Gods,<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> though God is
      One; another wishes the Father to be recognised in the Person of
      the Son <a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a>; another robs the Son of God
      of His Flesh,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a> through which the world has
      been reconciled to God, and there are yet others of the same kind,
      who admittedly are separated from Catholic Sacraments.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> Wherefore you should regret
      that you have coupled schismatics with such men as these, for,
      when you thought that you were attacking others, you failed to
      observe how wide is the gulf between schismatics and heretics, and
      turned the sword of judgement upon yourself.</p>
      <p>This is the reason that you do not see which is the Holy
      Church,<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> and have in this way made
      confusion of everything.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-marks-of-the-catholic-church-and-of-schism.">The marks
      of the Catholic Church, and of Schism.</h3>
      <p>Catholicism is constituted by a simple and true understanding
      in the law,<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a> by an unique and most true
      mystery,<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> and by unity of minds. But
      schism, after the bond of peace has been broken, is brought into
      existence through passion, is nourished by hatred, is strengthened
      by envy and dissensions, so that the Catholic Mother is abandoned,
      whilst her unfilial children go forth outside and separate
      themselves (as you have done) from the root of Mother Church—cut
      off by the shears of their hatred—and wickedly depart in
      rebellion. They are not able, however, to do anything new, or
      different <a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> from that which long ago
      they learned from their Mother.</p>
      <h3 id="to-return-to-the-difference-between-heretics-and-schismatics.">To
      return to the difference between heretics and schismatics.</h3>
      <p>But heretics, exiles from the truth, deserters of the sound and
      most true Creed,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a> corrupted by
      their wicked opinions and led astray from the bosom of Holy
      Church, reckoning nothing of their noble birth, in order to
      deceive the ignorant and ill-informed, have been pleased to be
      born of themselves. And they, who for a long time had been
      nourished on living food—which not assimilated has turned to
      corruption <a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a> —have by impious
      disputations vomited forth deadly poisons, to the destruction of
      their wretched dupes.</p>
      <p>You see, then, my brother Parmenian, that none but heretics
      only—who are cut off from the home of truth—possess ‘various kinds
      of false Baptisms with which he, who is stained, cannot wash, nor
      the unclean cleanse, nor the destroyer raise, nor he, who is lost,
      free, nor the guilty man give pardon, nor the condemned man
      absolve.’ <a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
      <p>Rightly hast thou closed the Garden to heretics; rightly hast
      thou claimed the Keys for Peter <a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a>; rightly hast thou denied
      the right of cultivating the young trees to those who are
      certainly shut out <a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a> from the
      garden and from the paradise of God <a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a>; rightly hast thou withdrawn
      the Ring from those to whom it is not allowed to open the
      Fountain. But to you schismatics, although you are not in the
      Catholic Church,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> these things
      <a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a> cannot be denied, since you
      have shared true Sacraments with us.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
      <p>Wherefore, since all these things are justly denied to
      heretics, why did you think well to deny them to yourselves as
      well, who clearly are schismatics, for you have gone outside? For
      our part we were willing that in this matter heretics alone should
      be condemned, but so far as lies with you, you have chosen to
      strike yourselves, together with them, in one condemnation.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a></p>

      <p>But now (to return to the order upon which we have determined),
      in the first place listen to the names of those who were Betrayers
      and learn more distinctly who were the originators of the schism.
      It is certain that two evil things have been perpetrated in
      Africa—even the worst of all <a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a> —the
      first—Betrayal, the second—Schism. Both these crimes were
      committed, in one period of time, by the same wicked men.</p>
      <p>You ought, therefore, my brother Parmenian, to learn that of
      which you are understood to be ignorant; for sixty years and more
      have passed since the storm of persecution spread abroad
      throughout the whole of Africa <a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> —a persecution which made
      some Martyrs, others Confessors, whilst not a few it laid low in a
      terrible death,<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a> leaving unharmed those who
      lay in hiding.</p>
      <p>Why should I make mention of laymen who at that time were
      supported by no ecclesiastical dignity? Why name a host of clerics
      <a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a>? Or deacons in the third,<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a> or priests in the second

      <a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>171</sup></a> of the law of God? Amongst
      whom were Donatus of Mascula, Victor of Rusicca, Merinus from the
      Baths of Tibilis, Donatus of Calama, and Purpurius of Limata, the
      murderer <a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> —who, when he was questioned

      ‘Yes, I did kill them, and not them alone do I kill, but whoever
      shall act against me.’ And Menalius who pretended that he had a

      people,<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174" role="doc-noteref"><sup>174</sup></a> for fear lest it should be
      proved against him by his fellow-citizens that he had offered
      incense to idols.</p>
      <h3 id="the-acts-of-the-council-of-cirta.">The acts of the Council
      of Cirta.</h3>
      <p>After the persecution, these Bishops and others whom we shall
      soon show to have been the first leaders of your schism, gathered
      together on the thirteenth of <a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175" role="doc-noteref"><sup>175</sup></a> at the town of Cirta <a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176" role="doc-noteref"><sup>176</sup></a> —in the house of Urbanus
      Carisius—for the Basilicas had not yet been restored. This is
      attested by the writings of Nundinarius,<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177" role="doc-noteref"><sup>177</sup></a> then a deacon, and is proved
      by the age of the parchments, which I can show to anyone really in
      doubt, for in the Appendix to these books I have subjoined the
      whole number <a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178" role="doc-noteref"><sup>178</sup></a> of these documents to
      certify the truth of my statements. These Bishops, on being
      questioned by Secundus of Tigisis, acknowledged that they had been
      Betrayers.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179" role="doc-noteref"><sup>179</sup></a> And, as Secundus <a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180" role="doc-noteref"><sup>180</sup></a> himself was taunted by
      Purpurius not for having escaped, but for having been set free
      after he had remained for a long time amongst the soldiers, they
      all stood up <a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181" role="doc-noteref"><sup>181</sup></a> and began to mutter that he
      had been set free only because he betrayed the sacred books. Then
      Secundus, fearing their temper, received advice from his brother’s
      son, Secundus the Less, to remit an affair of this character to
      God. <a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182" role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a> The others, who had not been
      accused, that is to say, Victor of Garba, Felix of Rotarium and
      Nabor of Centurio, were then consulted. They said that a case of
      this kind ought to be reserved to the Lord. Then said Secundus
      ‘Sit down all.’ They all replied ‘Thanks be to God,’ and sat down.
      You see, therefore, my brother Parmenian, that it is quite clear
      who were the Betrayers.</p>
      <h3 id="the-schism-took-its-rise-from-the-consecration-of-majorinus.">The
      schism took its rise from the consecration of Majorinus.</h3>
      <p>It was not long after this, that these very persons whom I have
      mentioned, of the character I have described, Betrayers, men who
      had offered incense to idols, and murderers,<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a> proceeded to Carthage, and
      there, although Caecilian was already the Bishop, made the Schism
      by consecrating Majorinus—on whose Chair, Parmenian, you sit. And
      since I have shown, that men who were guilty of Betrayal were your
      first fathers, it follows that Betrayers were also the originators
      of your Schism.</p>
      <p>In order to make this matter clear and beyond doubt to all, we
      shall have to prove from what root the branches of error have
      stretched themselves forth to the present day, and from what
      fountain this your rivulet of noxious water,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184" role="doc-noteref"><sup>184</sup></a> creeping stealthily along,
      has flowed down even to our times. We shall have to point out
      whence, and where, and from whom this evil of schism has arisen;
      what were the causes which met together <a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185" role="doc-noteref"><sup>185</sup></a> to produce it; who were the
      persons who effected it <a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a>; who were the
      authors of this wicked thing; who fostered it; by whom appeal was
      made to the Emperor, that he should judge between the parties; who
      were they that sat in judgement; where the Council was held; what
      were its decrees.</p>
      <p>The question is about a Division. Now in Africa, as in other
      parts of the world, the Church was One, before it was divided by
      those who consecrated Majorinus—whose Chair you have inherited,
      and now occupy.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a> We shall have to see who has
      remained in the root, with the whole world <a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188" role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a>; who went forth; who sits on
      a second chair, which had no existence before the Schism <a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189" role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a>; who has raised altar
      against altar; who has consecrated a Bishop when another was in
      undisturbed possession; who it is that lies under the judgement of
      John, the Apostle, when he declared that many Anti-Christs should
      go forth without,</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘because they were not of us, for if they had been of us they
      would have remained with us.’ <a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190" role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Therefore, he who was unwilling to remain with his brethren in
      unity <a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191" role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a> has followed the heretics,
      and gone forth without, as an Anti-Christ.</p>
      <h3 id="the-quarrel-of-lucilla-against-caecilian.">The quarrel of
      Lucilla against Caecilian.</h3>
      <p>No one is unaware that the Schism, after the consecration of
      Caecilian, was effected at Carthage through a certain
      mischief-making woman named Lucilla. When the Church was still in
      tranquillity, before her Peace had been disturbed by the storms of
      persecution, this woman could not put up with the rebuke which she
      received from the archdeacon Caecilian. It was said that she
      kissed a bone of some martyr or other—if he was a martyr—before
      she received the spiritual Food and Drink. Having then been
      corrected for thus touching—before she touched the Sacred
      Chalice—the bone of a dead man (if he was a martyr, at least he
      had not yet been acknowledged as such <a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a>), she went away in
      confusion, full of wrath. This was the woman upon whom, whilst she
      was angry and afraid that she might fall under the discipline of
      the Church, on a sudden, the storm of persecution broke.</p>
      <h3 id="mensurius-when-summoned-to-the-court-entrusted-the-ornaments-of-the-church-to-certain-seniors.">Mensurius
      when summoned to the court entrusted the ornaments of the Church
      to certain seniors.</h3>
      <p>It was at this time also that a deacon called Felix who had
      been summoned before the tribunals on account of a much spoken-of
      letter which he had written concerning the usurping Emperor, <a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193" role="doc-noteref"><sup>193</sup></a> fearing his danger, is said
      to have lain hidden in the house of Bishop Mensurius. When
      Mensurius publicly refused to give him up, an account of the
      matter was despatched. A rescript came back that unless Mensurius
      would surrender the deacon Felix, he should be himself sent to the
      palace.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194" role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a> On receiving this summons <a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195" role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a> he found himself in no small
      difficulty, for the Church possessed very many gold and silver
      ornaments, which he could neither hide under ground, nor take away
      with him. So he confided them to the care of some of the seniors,
      whom he believed to be worthy of trust, not, however, before he
      had made an inventory, which he is said to have given to a certain
      old woman. He charged her, that, when peace was restored to
      Christians, she should hand this over, if he himself did not
      return home, to whomsoever she found sitting on the Bishop’s
      Chair. He went away and pleaded his cause; he was commanded to
      return, but was not able to reach Carthage.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196" role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a></p>

      Consecration of Caecilian as Bishop of Carthage. The cause and the
      beginning of the Schism.</h3>
      <p>The storm of persecution passed over, and subsided. By the
      disposition of God, Maxentius sent pardon, and liberty was
      restored to Christians. Botrus and Celestius—so it is said—wishing
      to be consecrated Bishops at Carthage, arranged that, without
      inviting <a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197" role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> the Numidians, only the
      neighbouring bishops should be asked to perform the ceremony at
      Carthage.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198" role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a> Then, by the vote of the
      whole people, Caecilian was chosen, and was consecrated Bishop,
      Felix of Autumna laying his hand upon him. Botrus and Celestius
      were disappointed of their hope. The inventory of the gold and
      silver, as had been ordered by Mensurius, was handed over, in the
      presence of witnesses, to Caecilian, who was now in possession of
      the See. The above-mentioned seniors were summoned; but they had
      swallowed up in the jaws of their avarice, as booty, that which
      had been entrusted to their keeping. When they were commanded to
      make restitution, they withdrew from communion with Caecilian. The
      ambitious intriguers, who had failed to obtain their consecration,
      did likewise. Lucilla, too, that influential, mischief-making
      woman,<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199" role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a> who had before been
      unwilling to brook discipline, together with all her retainers,
      separated herself from her Bishop. Thus wickedness produced its
      effect through the meeting together <a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200" role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a> of three different causes
      and sets of persons.</p>
      <h3 id="the-unlawful-consecration-by-numidian-bishops-of-majorinus-against-caecilian.">The
      unlawful consecration by Numidian bishops of Majorinus against
      Caecilian.</h3>
      <p>In this way it came to pass, that at that time the Schism was
      brought to birth by the anger of a disgraced woman, was fed by
      ambition, and received its strength from avarice.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
      <p>It was by these three that the accusations were concocted
      against Caecilian, so that his Consecration might be declared
      void. They sent to Secundus of Tigisis <a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a> to come to Carthage, whither
      the Betrayers, of whom we have already made mention, proceeded.
      They received hospitality—not from Catholics, at whose request
      Caecilian had been consecrated <a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a> —but from the avaricious,
      from the ambitious, from those who had been unable to govern their
      tempers. Not one of them went to the Basilica, where all the
      people of Carthage had assembled with Caecilian.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a> Then Caecilian demanded:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If there is anything to be proved against me, let the accuser
      come out and prove it.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nothing could at that time be got up against him by all these
      enemies of his; they imagined, however, that he might be blackened
      by his Consecrator being falsely alleged to have been a Betrayer.
      So Caecilian gave a second demand—that, since—so they thought
      —Felix had bestowed nothing upon him, they should themselves
      ordain him, as if he were still a deacon.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205" role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
      <p>Then Purpurius, relying upon his usual ribaldry, thus spoke, as
      though Caecilian had been his sister’s son <a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let him stand forth as if he were to be consecrated Bishop,
      and let his head be well smacked in Penance.’ <a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207" role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When the bearing of all this was seen, the whole Church
      <span>[</span>of Carthage<span>]</span> retained Caecilian, in
      order not to hand itself over to murderers. <a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208" role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
      <p>The alternatives were, either that he should be expelled from
      his See as guilty, or that the Faithful should communicate with
      him as innocent.</p>
      <p>The church was crowded with people; Caecilian was sitting in
      his episcopal Chair; the altar was set up in its own place <a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209" role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a> —that very altar upon which
      Bishops acknowledged by all <a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210" role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a> had in past
      times offered sacrifice—Cyprian, Carpophorius,<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a> Lucian and the rest.</p>
      <p>In this manner they went forth,<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a> and altar was raised against
      altar; and there was an unlawful consecration; and Majorinus, who
      had been lector when Caecilian was archdeacon <a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213" role="doc-noteref"><sup>213</sup></a> —Majorinus, a member of the
      household of Lucilla—at her instigation, and through her
      bribes—was consecrated Bishop by Betrayers, who in the Numidian
      Council had (as we have already said) acknowledged their crimes
      and granted pardon to one another. It is, therefore, clear that
      both the Betrayers who consecrated, and Majorinus who was
      consecrated, went forth from the Church.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214" role="doc-noteref"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-letter-of-the-numidiau-bishops-against-felix-the-consecrator-of-caecilian.">The
      letter of the Numidiau Bishops against Felix, the consecrator of
      Caecilian.</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, out of the fountain of their own crimes, which had
      gushed forth amongst them in channels <a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215" role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a> of many kinds of wickedness,
      they thought that a single one—that of Betrayal—might be spared <a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216" role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a> with which to calumniate the
      consecrator of Caecilian. For, since, as they foresaw, slander
      would not be able to occupy herself at the same time with two
      charges of a similar nature, they endeavoured to blacken the life
      of another man, that by this means they might consign their own
      crimes to silence. And, through fear that they should themselves
      be convicted by the innocent, they strove to convict the innocent
      instead. To this end they distributed on all sides a letter,<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a> inspired by their hatred.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218" role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a> (This letter we have placed,
      together with the other Acts, in the Appendix.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219" role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a>)</p>
      <p>As they were still at Carthage, they sent their letters before
      them,<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220" role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a> that by untruthful reports
      they might plant their falsehood in the ears of all. Rumour spread
      the lie broadcast amongst the people. Thus, whilst these calumnies
      were noised abroad about one man only, their own most certain
      crimes were hidden away in silence.</p>
      <p>It often comes to pass that sin is blushed for, but at that
      period there was no one for whom to blush, since, with the
      exception of a few Catholics, all had sinned,<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221" role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a> so the wickedness which had
      been committed by many wore the cloak of innocence. The shame of
      Betrayal, which admittedly had been committed by Donatus of
      Mascula and the others whom we have mentioned, seemed but of small
      account. To this Betrayal they added the enormous wickedness of
      schism.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="how-grave-is-the-evil-of-schism-of-which-the-donatists-are-guilty.">How
      grave is the evil of Schism, of which the Donatists are
      guilty.</h3>
      <p>Therefore, my brother Parmenian, you see these two
      accusations—so evil, so terrible—of Betrayal and Schism proved
      against your chiefs. Acknowledge, though late, that you, in
      attacking others, have fallen upon your own people. And whilst it
      is certain that those who went before you worked this second
      abomination, you too strive to follow them in their sin-stained
      footsteps, so that you also have been doing for long, and are even
      now doing, that of which your Fathers were guilty in the beginning
      of the Schism.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>223</sup></a> They in their day broke
      peace; you now banish unity.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224" role="doc-noteref"><sup>224</sup></a> It can be said
      with reason of your Fathers as well as of yourselves, that, if the
      blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225" role="doc-noteref"><sup>225</sup></a> A raging malice blinded your
      Fathers’ eyes; envy has robbed yours of sight. Even you will not
      by any means be able to deny that schism is the supreme evil.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
      <p>Yet, without fear, you have imitated Dathan, Abiram and Koran,
      your shameless teachers,<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227" role="doc-noteref"><sup>227</sup></a> and you have
      been unwilling to keep before your eyes the fact that God has both
      forbidden this wickedness, and gravely punished it when it has
      been committed. Moreover, remember that the way in which sins are
      either forgiven or punished shows that there are degrees of
      guilt.</p>
      <p>Now, by the Commandments of God, three things are, amongst
      others, forbidden by Him. Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not go
      after <a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228" role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a> strange gods, and summing up
      the commands,<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a> thou shalt not commit
      schism.</p>
      <p>Let us see concerning these three, what should be punished, and
      what it may be lawful to pardon.</p>
      <p>Murder of kith is the chief sin.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a> Nevertheless, God did not
      strike Cain dead in his guilt, but declared that He would punish
      any man who might be his murderer. In the city of Nineve one
      hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants sacrilegiously followed
      after strange gods, but when, by the preaching of Jonah the
      prophet, God had declared His anger, a short period of fasting,
      together with prayer, obtained their pardon. Let us see whether
      any such forgiveness was granted to those who first of all
      ventured to divide the people of God.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231" role="doc-noteref"><sup>231</sup></a></p>
      <p>God had placed over so many thousands of children of Israel,
      from whose necks His Divine Providence had cast away the yoke of
      servitude, one Priest, holy Aaron. But his ministers, coveting and
      lawlessly usurping a priesthood to which they had no right, and
      leading astray a part of the people, imitated the sacred rites,
      and placed more than two hundred of their followers (who were to
      perish with them)—censers in their hands—before the people whom
      they had led astray. God, to whom schism is displeasing, could not
      see this and let it pass; they had, after a certain fashion,
      declared war against God, as if there were a second God,<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232" role="doc-noteref"><sup>232</sup></a> who would accept a second
      sacrifice. Therefore God was wrathful with a mighty wrath, on
      account of the schism which had been made, and what He had not
      done in punishment of the sacrilegious and the fratricide,<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233" role="doc-noteref"><sup>233</sup></a> that He did do in punishment
      of schismatics. The army of ministers stood in array, and the
      sacrilegious host that (together with its forbidden sacrifices)
      was to perish in an instant. The opportunity for penance was
      denied them and withdrawn, for this was not the kind of sin that
      should deserve pardon. The earth was commanded to hunger after its
      food. Forthwith it opened its jaws for those who had divided the
      people, and with eager mouth swallowed them up that had despised
      the commandments of God. Within the space of one moment the earth
      opened to devour them, seized her victims, was shut once again,
      and, so that they might not appear to reap any benefit from the
      suddenness of their death, it was not allowed these men who were
      unworthy to live even to die. Of a sudden they were shut in the
      prison of Hell, and were buried there before they died.</p>
      <p>And yet you wonder that something of similar severity has been
      done against you—you who either cause or approve schism, although
      you see here what they, who compassed the first schism, deserved
      to suffer! Or is it because punishment of this kind has now
      ceased, that on this account you claim innocence for yourself and
      for your party? In each of these occurrences, God has set forth a
      model by examples <a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234" role="doc-noteref"><sup>234</sup></a> of the
      punishment that will come to their imitators. The first sins He
      has put an end to with punishment, as an example for all time. The
      sins that come after He will reserve for His Judgement. What have
      you to say to this, you, who having usurped the name of the
      Church, both secretly foster and without shame defend the
      schism?</p>

      <p>I hear that some of your party, in their love of disputation,

      trust, which are in accordance with reason, which agree with the
      truth <a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235" role="doc-noteref"><sup>235</sup></a>? It may be that your
      documents—if indeed you have any—will be found to be stained with
      falsehoods. Our documents are proved to be true by the rival
      arguments and pleadings of the parties, by the final judgements,
      and by the letters of Constantine.</p>
      <p>With regard to that which you ask of us:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘What have Christians to do with kings, or Bishops with the
      palace?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If it be a crime <a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236" role="doc-noteref"><sup>236</sup></a> to be
      acquainted with kings, the whole of the odium falls upon you, for
      your fathers Lucianus, Dignus, Nasutius, Capito, Fidentius and the
      rest, when the Emperor Constantine was still without any knowledge
      of these affairs, addressed a petition to him, of which I will
      transcribe a copy <a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>

      Dignus, Nasutius, Capito, Fidentius and the rest of the Bishops
      who adhere to Donatus.’ <a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

      answer of Constantine. He appointed Judges to meet at Rome.</h3>
      <p>After having read this letter, Constantine replied with much
      anger. And in his rescript he testified to the matter of their
      petition in the words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You ask a judgement from me in this world, although I myself
      am waiting for the Judgement of Christ in the next.’ <a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240" role="doc-noteref"><sup>240</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nevertheless, he granted them judges—Maternus from the city of
      Cologne, Reticius from the city of Autun, Marinus of Aries. These
      three Bishops from Gaul and fifteen others, who were Italians,
      arrived in Rome. They met in the House of Fausta on the Lateran,
      on the second of October which was a Friday, in the year when
      Constantine for the fourth, and Licinius for the third time, were
      Consuls.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241" role="doc-noteref"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
      <p>There were present Miltiades,<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242" role="doc-noteref"><sup>242</sup></a> Bishop of the city of Rome,

      acquittal of Caecilian by the Roman Council.</h3>
      <p>When these nineteen Bishops had taken their seats together, the
      case of Donatus and that of Caecilian were brought forward. This
      judgement was passed against Donatus <a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243" role="doc-noteref"><sup>243</sup></a> —by each of the Bishops—that
      he acknowledged having both rebaptised, and laid his hand in
      Penance upon Bishops who had fallen away— a thing foreign to the
      Church.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244" role="doc-noteref"><sup>244</sup></a> Donatus brought forth his
      witnesses; they admitted that they had nothing of which they could
      accuse Caecilian. Caecilian was pronounced innocent by the
      sentence of all the above-named Bishops; also by the sentence of
      Miltiades, by which the matter was closed, and judgement
      pronounced in these words <a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245" role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Since it is certain that those who came with Donatus have
      failed to accuse Caecilian in accordance with their undertaking,
      and since it is also certain that Donatus has not proved him
      guilty on any count, I judge that, according to his deserts, he be
      maintained in the communion of the Church, continuing to hold his
      position unimpaired.’ <a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a></p>

      Constantine received the appeal of Donatus from the Roman

      <p>It is, therefore, sufficient, that Donatus was condemned by the

      judgement of so great an authority.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a> Yet Donatus thought well to
      appeal. To this appeal the Emperor Constantine replied in these

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Oh, mad daring of their fury! A Bishop has thought fit to
      appeal to us, as is done in the lawsuits of the Pagans.’ <a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a></p>

      <h3 id="what-took-place-in-africa-after-the-roman-synod.">What
      took place in Africa after the Roman Synod.</h3>
      <p>At the same time Donatus also asked that he might be allowed to
      return, and promised that he would not go to Carthage.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249" role="doc-noteref"><sup>249</sup></a> Then it was suggested to the
      Emperor by Filuminus his advocate,<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a> that, for peace’ sake,
      Caecilian should be detained at Brescia—and so it was done.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251" role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a> Then two Bishops were sent
      to Africa, Eunomius and Olimpius, to do away with the dual Bishops
      and establish a single one.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252" role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a> They came, and

      party of Donatus could not endure this, and every day noisy
      uproars were made through party spirit.</p>
      <p>Eventually these Bishops, Eunomius and Olimpius, delivered
      their final decree to the effect that the Catholic Church <a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254" role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a> was that which was dispersed
      all over the world, and that the Judgement of the nineteen Bishops
      which had already been delivered could not be upset.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255" role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a> Accordingly they
      communicated with the clergy of Caecilian, and went their way. All
      this we can prove from the written Acts which any who please may
      read in our Appendix.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256" role="doc-noteref"><sup>256</sup></a> When these
      things had taken place, Donatus was the first to return to
      Carthage, unasked. Caecilian, on hearing this news, hastened back
      to his own people. In this way the schism was planted anew. But
      the fact remains that so many Bishops had by their Judgement
      condemned Donatus, and had also pronounced the innocence of
      Caecilian.</p>
      <h3 id="the-clearing-of-felix-the-consecrator-of-caecilian.">The
      clearing of Felix, the Consecrator of Caecilian.</h3>
      <p>But since two persons on the Catholic side had been for some
      time accused in this matter—the consecrated and the
      Consecrator—even after the consecrated had been acquitted at Rome,
      it still remained for the Consecrator to be declared guiltless.
      Then Constantine wrote to Aelianus, the pro-consul, to lay aside
      his public duties and make public inquiry into the life of Felix
      of Autumna.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257" role="doc-noteref"><sup>257</sup></a></p>
      <p>The appointed officer took his seat. The witnesses were
      Claudius Saturianus,<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258" role="doc-noteref"><sup>258</sup></a> a state
      commissioner, who had been in the city of Felix all through the
      time of the persecution, and had been a commissioner when he was
      impeached, Callidius Gratianus and Alfius Caecilianus the
      magistrate; also Superius the Warder was summoned, and Ingentius
      the public notary, who was in constant fear of the torture with
      which he was threatened. By the evidence of all it was ascertained
      that there was nothing that could disgrace the life of Felix the
      Bishop.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
      <p>The Volume of Acts is in existence in which are recorded the
      names of those who had been present at the trial, Claudius
      Saturianus the official, and Caecilianus the Magistrate, and
      Superius the Warder, and Ingentius the Notary, and Solon a public
      official of the time. After they had given their replies, the
      above-mentioned pro-consul gave his Judgement, of which this is a
      part:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘That Felix, the holy Bishop, is guiltless of having burned the
      divine Books,<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a> is clear from the fact that
      no one was able to prove anything against him—neither that he had
      given up nor burned the most sacred Scriptures. For all the
      above-mentioned witnesses proved clearly that none of the divine
      Writings had been either discovered, or injured or burned. It is
      shown by the Acts that the holy Bishop Felix was not present at
      that time, and that he was neither privy to any such crime, nor
      commanded it to be done.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And so he left the court, cleared of every stain upon his
      reputation and wonderfully praised. Up to that time men did not
      know what to think of him, and he had walked under a dark cloud,
      caused by the breath of hatred and jealousy, whilst truth lay hid.
      And besides, every document, mentioned either in the Acts or in
      the letters which we have mentioned or read, was disclosed.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-end-of-this-first-book.">The end of this First

      <p>You see, my brother Parmenian, that you have assaulted
      Catholics to no purpose—falsely nicknaming them Betrayers,
      changing the names of those who were concerned, and transferring
      their deeds. You have shut your eyes, that you might not recognise
      the guilt of your fathers; you have opened them to cast
      accusations upon the innocent and blameless.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a> You have stated everything

      against others have glanced back—warded off by the shield of
      truth—to strike your fathers. Everything, then, which you have
      been able to say against Betrayers and schismatics, belongs to

      take place before our eyes.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266" role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a> The difference
      between heresy and schism has also been explained. It is now our

      Bride.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
      <p>The Church, then, is One, and her holiness is not measured by
      the pride of individuals,<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a> but is derived
      from the Sacraments. It is for this reason that she alone is

      Church may be where it pleases you, and may not be where it
      pleases you not. And so, in order that she may be with you in a
      little piece of Africa, in a corner of one small region, is she
      not to be with us in another part of Africa? Is she not to be in
      Spain, in Gaul, in Italy, where you are not? If you maintain that
      she is with you only, is she not to be in Pannonia, in Dacia,
      Moesia, Thrace, Achaia, Macedonia and in all Greece, where you are
      not? In order that you may be able to argue that she is with you,
      is she not to be in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Pamphylia,
      Phrygia, Cilicia and in the three Syrias, and in the two Armenias,
      and in all Egypt and in Mesopotamia, where you are not? And is she
      not to be throughout innumerable islands and so many other

      <p>Where in that case will be the application of the Catholic
      Name,<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a> since on this very account
      was the Church called Catholic, because she is in accordance with
      reason, and is scattered all over the world? <a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273" role="doc-noteref"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
      <p>For if you limit the Church just as it may please you, into a
      narrow corner, if you withdraw whole peoples from her communion,
      where will that be which the Son of God has merited, where will
      that be which the Father has freely granted Him, saying, in the
      second Psalm:</p>

      <p>To what purpose do you break so mighty a promise, so that the
      breadth of all the kingdoms is compressed by you into a sort of
      narrow prison? Why do you strive to stand in the way of so great a
      largesse? Why do you fight against the Saviour’s Merits? Permit
      the Son to possess that which has been granted to Him; permit the
      Father to fulfil that which He has promised.</p>
      <p>Why do you put bounds, why set limits? There is nothing in any
      part of the earth which has been withheld from His dominion, since
      the whole earth has been promised by God the Father to the
      Saviour. The whole earth has been granted to Him together with its
      nations. The whole world is Christ’s as His undivided
      possession.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275" role="doc-noteref"><sup>275</sup></a> God proves this when he
      says:</p>

      <p>‘He shall reign from sea to sea, and from the waters to the
      bounds of the world.’ <a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277" role="doc-noteref"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When the Father gives, He makes no exception; you, that you may
      give Him one fraction, endeavour to take away the whole measure.
      And, still, you endeavour to persuade men that the Church is
      amongst you alone, taking away from Christ that which He has
      won—denying that God has performed His promises. What ingratitude!
      What folly! What presumption is yours! Christ invites you, with
      all others, into the company of the Heavenly Kingdom and exhorts
      you to be co-heirs with Him; and you strive to rob Him of the
      inheritance given Him by the Father, allowing Him a part of Africa
      and refusing Him the whole world, which the Father has bestowed
      upon Him.</p>
      <p>Why do you desire to make the Holy Ghost appear a liar, who in
      the forty-ninth Psalm tells of the goodness of Almighty God,
      saying:</p>

      <p>Therefore the earth has been called to become flesh.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279" role="doc-noteref"><sup>279</sup></a> And, as it has been written,
      so has it been done, and the earth owes praises to its
      Creator.</p>
      <p>Once more this is mentioned, where the Holy Spirit exhorts us
      in the hundred and twelfth Psalm with the words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The Name of the Lord must be praised from the rising of the
      sun even to its going down.’ <a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280" role="doc-noteref"><sup>280</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And again, in the ninety-fifth Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Sing ye to the Lord a new song.’ <a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If this were the only verse, you might say that the Holy Ghost
      had exhorted you alone. But that He might show that this has been
      said not to you alone, but to the Church which is everywhere, He
      continued:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Sing to the Lord, all the earth; declare amongst the nations
      His glory, His wonderful works amongst all peoples.’ <a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282" role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Declare amongst the nations.’ <a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He did not say, ‘in a small part of Africa, where you are’; He
      did say ‘Declare amongst all peoples.’ <a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284" role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a></p>
      <p>He who said ‘all peoples’ excepted no man. Yet you are proud to
      be alone and separated from ‘all peoples,’ though to them this
      command was given; and you maintain that you, who are not <em>in
      any part of the whole</em>,<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a> are yet
      yourselves alone the whole.</p>
      <p>He has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The name of the Lord must be praised,’ and ‘by all the earth

      <p>Can then the Pagans, who are outside the covenant of Christ,<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a> either sing to God or praise
      the name of the Lord? Is it not His Church alone, which is within

      the mouths of all the Christian nations. You have imposed silence

      If then God waits for the praise which is His due, and if the Holy

      <p>But <a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312" role="doc-noteref"><sup>312</sup></a> you allege that you too have
      some sort of a party in the City of Rome.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313" role="doc-noteref"><sup>313</sup></a></p>
      <p>It is a branch of your error growing out of a lie, not from the
      root of truth. In a word, were Macrobius <a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314" role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a> to be asked where he sits in
      the City, will he be able to say on Peter’s Cathedra? I doubt
      whether he has even set eyes upon it, and schismatic that he is,
      he has not drawn nigh to Peter’s ‘Shrine,’ <a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315" role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a> against the precept of the
      Apostle who writes:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Communicating with the “Shrines” of the Saints.’ <a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316" role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Behold, in Rome are the ‘Shrines’ of the two Apostles. Will you
      tell me whether he has been able to approach them, or has offered
      Sacrifice in those places, where—as is certain—are these ‘Shrines’
      of the Saints.</p>
      <p>So it follows that your colleague Macrobius must confess that
      he sits where once sat Encolpius; and if Encolpius himself could
      be questioned, he would say that he sat where before him sat
      Bonifacius of Balla; and if Bonifacius could be asked, he would in
      his turn reply that he sat where Victor of Garba sat, whom some
      time ago your people sent from Africa to a few wanderers.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317" role="doc-noteref"><sup>317</sup></a></p>
      <p>How do you explain that your party has not been able to possess
      a Roman citizen as Bishop in Rome? How is it that in that City
      they were all Africans <a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318" role="doc-noteref"><sup>318</sup></a> and strangers
      who are known to have succeeded one another? Is not craft here
      manifest? Is this not the spirit of faction—the mother of
      schism?</p>
      <p>This Victor of Garba was sent first, I will not say as a stone
      into a fountain (for he could not ruffle the pure waters of the
      Catholic people), but because some Africans who belonged to your
      party, having gone to Rome, and wishing to live there, begged that
      someone should be sent from Africa to preside over their public
      worship. So Victor was sent to them. He was there as a son without
      a father, as a beginner without a master, as a disciple without a
      teacher, as a follower without a predecessor,<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319" role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a> as a lodger without a home,
      as a guest without a guest-house, as a shepherd without a flock,
      as a Bishop without a people. For neither flock nor people can
      that handful be termed, who amongst the forty and more Basilicas
      in Rome, had not one place in which to assemble.</p>
      <p>Accordingly they closed up <a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320" role="doc-noteref"><sup>320</sup></a> a cave outside the City with
      trellis-work,<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a> where they might have a
      meeting-house at once,<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322" role="doc-noteref"><sup>322</sup></a> and on account
      of this were called Mountaineers.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323" role="doc-noteref"><sup>323</sup></a></p>
      <p>Since then, Claudian has succeeded to Lucian, Lucian to
      Macrobius, Macrobius to Encolpius, Encolpius to Boniface, Boniface
      to Victor. Victor would not have been able, had he been asked
      where he sat,<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324" role="doc-noteref"><sup>324</sup></a> to show that anyone had been
      there <a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325" role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a> before him, nor could he
      have pointed out that he possessed any Cathedra save the Cathedra
      of pestilence <a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326" role="doc-noteref"><sup>326</sup></a>; for pestilence sends down
      its victims, destroyed by diseases, to the regions of Hell which
      are known to have their gates—gates against which we read that
      Peter received the saving Keys—Peter, that is to say, the first of
      our line,<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327" role="doc-noteref"><sup>327</sup></a> to whom it was said by
      Christ:</p>

      <p>and these keys</p>

      <p>‘the gates of Hell shall not overcome.’ <a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328" role="doc-noteref"><sup>328</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>How is it, then, that you strive to usurp for yourselves the
      Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, you who, with your arguments, and
      audacious sacrilege, war against the Chair of Peter? <a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329" role="doc-noteref"><sup>329</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-donatist-authors-of-schism-foes-of-peace.">The

      <p>Thus do you repudiate the blessedness deserved by him who
      walked not in the counsel of the wicked, and did not stand in the
      way of sinners, and sat not on the Chair of Pestilence.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330" role="doc-noteref"><sup>330</sup></a> Your fathers walked in the
      counsel of the ungodly, to divide the Church. They also walked in
      the way of sinners, when they strove to divide Christ, whose
      garments not even the Jews would rend, though the Apostle Paul
      cries out and says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Is then Christ divided?’ <a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331" role="doc-noteref"><sup>331</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Would that your fathers, after having already walked in the
      evil way, had recognised their sin, and turned back upon
      themselves; would that they had set right their wicked deeds;
      would that they had recalled the Peace <a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332" role="doc-noteref"><sup>332</sup></a> which they had put to
      flight.</p>
      <p>That would have been to turn back on their way, for on the way
      we have to walk, not stand still. But, since your fathers would
      not come back, it is certain that they <em>stood</em> in the way
      of sinners. They, whose steps had been impelled by mad wickedness,
      were held back, bound and benumbed by the spirit of strife; and,
      that they might not be able to return to better things, themselves
      placed the shackles of schism upon themselves, so that with
      obstinacy they stood in their error, and were not able to come
      back to the Peace which they had deserted. Nor did they listen to
      the Holy Spirit speaking in the thirty-third Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Turn away from evil and do good; seek Peace and pursue it’ <a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333" role="doc-noteref"><sup>333</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>but they <em>stood</em> in the way of their sins.</p>
      <p>Your fathers also sat on the Chair of Pestilence, which, as we
      have said above, sends down to death those whom it has beguiled.
      But you, whilst by your zealous defence you pay homage to your
      fathers’ error, have made yourselves the heirs of their
      wickedness, when you might have been, though late, the sons of
      Peace. For it has been written in the Prophet Ezekiel:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Raise thy voice over the son of the sinner, that he follow not
      in his father’s footsteps, since the soul of the father is Mine
      and Mine is the soul of the son. The soul which sins, alone shall
      be punished.’ <a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334" role="doc-noteref"><sup>334</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you would disown your fathers’ sin, they alone would have to
      give an account of their own deed.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335" role="doc-noteref"><sup>335</sup></a> By acting thus, even you
      might be blessed and receive praise from the mouth of the Prophet,
      who says in the first Psalm:</p>
      <p>‘Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
      ungodly nor stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the
      Chair of Pestilence, but has his will in the Law of the Lord.’ <a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336" role="doc-noteref"><sup>336</sup></a></p>
      <p>What does it mean to have the ‘will in the Law,’ unless both to
      learn the divine precepts with piety, and fulfil them with fear—to
      have the will set on that Law in which it has been written (in the
      Gospel):</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Peace on earth to men of good will,’ <a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337" role="doc-noteref"><sup>337</sup></a> <em></em></p>

      <p>and in another place (in Isaiah the Prophet <a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338" role="doc-noteref"><sup>338</sup></a>):</p>
      <blockquote>

      is not with the Donatists.</h3>
      <p>So, of the above-mentioned Endowments, the <em>Cathedra</em>
      is, as we have said, the first, which we have proved to be ours,
      through Peter, and which draws to itself the ANGEL <a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a> —unless, perchance, you
      claim him for yourselves, and have him shut up somewhere or
      other.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a> Send him out if you can, and
      let him exclude from his communion seven angels, our colleagues in
      Asia, to whose churches wrote the Apostle John—churches with which
      <a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353" role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a> you cannot prove that you
      have any intercourse whatsoever.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a></p>
      <p>On what ground, then, can you maintain that you possess an
      Angel able to move the Fountain,<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a> or one who, as such, can be
      numbered among the other Endowments of the Church?</p>
      <p>Whatever is without the Seven Churches is alien.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356" role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a> Supposing then that you
      really had even one <em>Angel</em> who belongs to the Church,
      through that one <em>Angel</em> you would be in communion with
      other <em>Angels</em> too, and through them with the
      above-mentioned Churches, and through these Churches <a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357" role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> with us also.</p>
      <p>If these things be as I have stated them, you have lost your

      <p>Now perhaps you will see that the Endowments of the Church
      cannot be with you, for you cannot claim for yourselves alone the
      SPIRIT of God,<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>359</sup></a> nor can you shut up <a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360" role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a> (in a small corner of
      Africa) Him whose Presence we recognise though we see it not.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a> For so has it been written

      <p>Permit God to come whence He willeth, and allow Him freedom to

      <p>Thou <a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365" role="doc-noteref"><sup>365</sup></a> hast vomited forth thine
      invective and hast thought that thou mightest thus be able to

      <p>If this accusation—unjust and groundless though it be—had to be

      Consecration. For you have reminded us that we read in the

      <p>that is, to change his sect. As for you personally, I have no

      <p>It is certain that the FOUNTAIN <a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370" role="doc-noteref"><sup>370</sup></a> also is one of the
      Endowments, from which heretics can neither drink themselves, nor
      give others to drink. For, as they alone <a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371" role="doc-noteref"><sup>371</sup></a> do not possess the SEAL,
      that is to say the Catholic Creed, in its integrity, they cannot
      open the true <em>Fountain.</em></p>

      <p>For <a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372" role="doc-noteref"><sup>372</sup></a> since it has been written in

      </blockquote>
      <p>you have tried to say that the <em>Navel</em> is the Altar. If
      the Navel be a member of the body, from the fact that it is a
      member, it cannot be amongst the Endowments. To be an Ornament, it
      must not be part of the body.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374" role="doc-noteref"><sup>374</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-endowments-of-the-church-are-with-catholics-not-with-donatists">The
      Endowments of the Church are with Catholics; not with
      Donatists</h3>
      <p>The Endowments then are seen to be Five. Since these Endowments
      belong to the Catholic Church (which is in so many countries
      already mentioned by us), they cannot be wanting to us here in
      Africa.</p>
      <p>Understand, however late, that you are disobedient sons, that
      you are boughs broken off from the tree, that you are branches cut
      off from the vine, that you are a river separated from its source.
      For that stream which is small and which is derived from another
      cannot be the source. Nor can the tree be cut off from the
      branch,<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375" role="doc-noteref"><sup>375</sup></a> since the tree, which has
      been planted and is alive, has its own roots; whereas the branch,
      which has been cut off, withers and dies.</p>
      <p>Now do you see, my brother Parmenian, now do you recognise, now
      do you understand, that by your arguments you have fought against
      yourself?</p>
      <p>For it has been proved that we are in the Holy Catholic Church,
      who have too the Creed of the Trinity <a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376" role="doc-noteref"><sup>376</sup></a>; and it has been shown that,
      through the Chair of Peter which is ours—through it <a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377" role="doc-noteref"><sup>377</sup></a> —the other Endowments also
      belong to us.</p>
      <p>Again, ours is the <em>Sacerdotium,</em> which you have
      affected to regard as in our case of no account <a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378" role="doc-noteref"><sup>378</sup></a>—by way of some excuse for
      your error and hatred in re-baptising after us—though this you do
      not after your own people, even when they have been proved guilty
      of sin; for you have maintained that, if the priest be in sin,<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a> the Endowments are able to
      work alone.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380" role="doc-noteref"><sup>380</sup></a></p>
      <p>So—to answer you—we have shown what is heresy, and what is
      schism, and which is the Holy Church, and that of this Holy Church
      there has been constituted a Representative,<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381" role="doc-noteref"><sup>381</sup></a> and that the Catholic Church
      is the Church which is scattered over the whole world (of which we
      amongst others are members), and that her Endowments are with her
      everywhere.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382" role="doc-noteref"><sup>382</sup></a> We have also shown in our
      first Book that we cannot justly be reproached with the crime of

      but by us also.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383" role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="catholics-possess-the-sacraments.">Catholics possess the
      Sacraments.</h3>
      <p>Now I should like you to tell me this. Why have you thought
      well to speak only of the Endowments of the Church, and have said
      nothing about her holy members and her inward organs,<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384" role="doc-noteref"><sup>384</sup></a> which without doubt are in
      the Sacraments and in the Names of the Trinity <a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385" role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a>? These Names are met by
      Faith and its profession, recorded upon the Acts of the Angels <a href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386" role="doc-noteref"><sup>386</sup></a>; here are sown heavenly and
      spiritual seeds, so that, for those who are born again, a new
      nature <a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387" role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a> may be procreated from a
      holy germ, and he who had once been born to the world may, where
      the Trinity meets Faith, be spiritually new-born <a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388" role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a> to God.</p>
      <p>In this way does God become the Father of men, thus does the
      Holy Church become their Mother.</p>
      <p>I perceive that all these things have been left unmentioned by
      you, on purpose, lest in them all, the true principles of Baptism
      <a href="#fn389" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389" role="doc-noteref"><sup>389</sup></a> might be recognised, in
      which there is nothing that the human minister may, after your
      fashion, claim for himself.</p>
      <p>For this reason you determined to occupy yourself with the
      Endowments alone, which you have denied to Catholics, vainly
      striving to claim them for yourselves exclusively, having clutched
      them, as it were in your hand, or shut them up in a box.<a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390" role="doc-noteref"><sup>390</sup></a> Although the question is
      about regeneration, and man’s renovation, you have made no mention
      either of Faith or of its profession by the Faithful. You
      determined rather to speak of the Endowments alone, and have
      passed over in silence all these things without which spiritual
      faith and reparation cannot exist. And although the Endowments
      belong to the Spouse, not the Spouse to the Endowments, you dealt
      with the Endowments as if life were given by them, not by the
      inward organs, which we understand to be rather in the Sacraments
      than in the Ornaments.</p>
      <h3 id="the-church-is-rightly-called-paradise-but-it-belongs-to-the-wide-world.">The
      Church is rightly called Paradise, but it belongs to the wide
      world.</h3>
      <p>Nor do I pass over the fact that you have said openly that the
      Church is (as we believe) a Paradise—a thing which without doubt
      is true—a garden in which God sets His little trees. And yet you
      have denied to God His rich possessions by compressing His garden
      into a narrow corner,<a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref391" role="doc-noteref"><sup>391</sup></a> claiming
      without reason everything for yourselves alone. Surely the
      plantations of God, through different precepts, have different
      seeds. The just, the continent, the merciful, the virgins are
      spiritual seeds. Of these seeds God raises little plants in His
      Paradise. Grant to God that His garden be spread far and wide. Why
      do you deny to Him the Christian peoples of East and North, also
      those of all the provinces of the West and of innumerable islands
      —with whom you share no fellowship of communion—against whom
      you—few in number and rebels—are ranged, in isolation?</p>

      the One Church, which has been spread throughout the whole

      beyond the sea,<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412" role="doc-noteref"><sup>412</sup></a> and this unity itself,<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413" role="doc-noteref"><sup>413</sup></a> through the representation
      of all its members, made the Body of the Church solid. And then
      over this the Devil, whom it always tortures to see brethren
      living in peace, was sorely vexed.</p>
      <p>At that time, under a Christian Emperor, Satan, as if shut up
      in the idols, lay abandoned in his temples. Your leaders too and
      first fathers had been sent, as they deserved; into banishment. In
      the Church there were no schisms. Pagans were not allowed their
      sacrilegious rites. Peace, beloved by God, dwelt amongst all
      Christian peoples. The devil mourned in his temples; you mourned
      in foreign lands.</p>
      <h3 id="the-edict-of-julian.">The Edict of Julian.</h3>
      <p>Next, as is known to all men, there followed another Emperor,
      who, in conjunction with you, devised evil plans, and from the
      servant of God became the tool of God’s enemy. His edicts bore him
      witness that he was an apostate. Yet this was the man whom you
      entreated to be allowed to return.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414" role="doc-noteref"><sup>414</sup></a> If you deny that you sent
      such entreaties, we reply that we have read them. Nor did he whom
      you entreated make difficulties. He commanded you to come back,<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415" role="doc-noteref"><sup>415</sup></a> as you asked. For he knew
      well that you would come, with fierceness, to break up Peace.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416" role="doc-noteref"><sup>416</sup></a></p>
      <p>If you have any shame, blush.</p>
      <p>The same decree, which gave freedom to you, ordered the temples
      to be opened to their idols.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417" role="doc-noteref"><sup>417</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="the-madness-and-cruelty-of-the-donatists.">The madness and
      cruelty of the Donatists.</h3>
      <p>You returned, in your madness, to Africa almost at the moment
      when the devil was loosed from his dungeons.</p>
      <p>Still you do not blush—you who, at the same time as the Enemy,
      have reasons for rejoicing, which you share with him.</p>
      <p>You came raging; you came full of wrath, rending the members of
      the Church; subtle in your deceits; savage in your slaughters,
      provoking the children of Peace to war. A large number you
      banished from their homes. Approaching with a hired band, you
      rushed upon the Basilicas. Many of your party throughout numerous
      districts (which it would be too long to mention by their names)
      worked massacres so bloody, that the judges of the time sent a
      report to the Emperor <a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418" role="doc-noteref"><sup>418</sup></a> concerning
      deeds of such atrocity.</p>
      <p>But the Judgement of God intervened and came to our aid, so
      that the Emperor who had already long ago ordered you to come
      back,<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419" role="doc-noteref"><sup>419</sup></a> and who, at your
      instigation, had arranged, or was even then arranging, for our
      persecution, died in the midst of his profanity and
      sacrileges.</p>
      <h3 id="the-donatists-murderous-deeds.">The Donatists’ murderous
      deeds.</h3>
      <p>Catholics were slaughtered in the above-mentioned districts.
      You remember how your people ran to and fro from place to place.
      Were not Felix of Zaba and Januarius of Flumenpiscinum of your
      party, and the others who rushed all together as swiftly as they
      could, to a fortified place called Lemella <a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420" role="doc-noteref"><sup>420</sup></a> ? So soon as they saw that
      the Basilica, notwithstanding their clamours, was closed against
      them, they commanded their followers to climb to the top, strip
      the roof, and throw down the tiles. These orders were executed
      without delay. In the defence of the altar, a number of Catholic
      deacons were wounded with tiles—of whom two were killed—Primus the
      son of Januarius, and Donatus the son of Ninus. Your
      fellow-Bishops, whose names I have just given, were present and
      urged them on, so that, without doubt, of your party has it been
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Their feet are swift to shed blood.’ <a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421" role="doc-noteref"><sup>421</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Primosus, the Catholic Bishop of the place, complained of all
      this—whilst you listened disingenuously to his complaints—at your
      Council held in the City of Theneste.</p>
      <p>See then how <em>you</em> did the things, of which you have
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘That is not the Church which battens on bloody morsels’;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and again you have said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Soldiers sent to war are one thing, consecrated Bishops are
      another.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What in your hatred you bring as a charge against us was done
      by others, not by us; that which you say ought not to have been
      done, has been done by you.</p>
      <p>You have recalled how the most blessed Apostle Paul has said
      that the Church ought to be <a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref422" role="doc-noteref"><sup>422</sup></a> without
      wrinkle and without stain.<a href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423" role="doc-noteref"><sup>423</sup></a> In the
      presence, and at the order, of your Bishops, Catholic deacons were
      slain over the altar.<a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424" role="doc-noteref"><sup>424</sup></a></p>
      <p>The same things happened also at Carpi.<a href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425" role="doc-noteref"><sup>425</sup></a> Do not such deeds appear to
      you indelible stains? When you came into the cities of Mauritania,
      the people were overwhelmed with dread, so that children who were
      near to birth died in their mothers’ wombs. Does not this seem to
      you to be a ‘wrinkle’ such as cannot be stretched or made smooth
      <a href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref426" role="doc-noteref"><sup>426</sup></a> by any reparation
      whatsoever? What have <em>we</em> done of such a character as
      this? We wait for the vengeance of God.</p>
      <p>And yet you create a prejudice against Macarius, although
      anything that he may have done with harshness on behalf of unity
      may well be regarded as of light account, when compared with these
      monstrous, bitter, bloodstained acts of war done by you on behalf
      of dissension. Why should I mention Tipasa, a city of Mauritania
      Caesariensis, whither rushed from Numidia Urban of Forma and Felix
      of Idicra, two burning torches, set on fire by hatred <a href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref427" role="doc-noteref"><sup>427</sup></a>? These men upset the minds
      of quiet people, who were established in unity,<a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref428" role="doc-noteref"><sup>428</sup></a> and, aided by the favour and
      fury of certain officials, in the very presence of Athenias the
      magistrate, with colours flying,<a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429" role="doc-noteref"><sup>429</sup></a> broke up the Catholic
      assemblies, with bloodshed. Catholics were driven out from their
      homes. Their men were wounded. Their women were dragged into
      captivity. Their infants were slain. Mothers miscarried.</p>
      <p>Look now at your church. Under the guidance of its Bishops
      it</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘battened on bloody morsels.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>After all this, you have gone on to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let the greed of vultures consume whatever it will; still the
      number of doves is greater.’ <a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430" role="doc-noteref"><sup>430</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What, then, has happened to the common saying that a liar
      should have his memory in due keeping? Have you forgotten what you
      said a moment before, that in the Canticle of Canticles</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The Church is Christ’s one Dove’ <a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>431</sup></a>?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If yours is the One Church, the Dove is One. What then did you
      mean by saying that</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘the number of doves is greater’?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p># The Eucharist was given by the Donatists to dogs. An Ampulla
      of Chrism was thrown away. Their other sacrileges.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a hideous crime (which seems to you something of
      little importance) <a href="#fn432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432" role="doc-noteref"><sup>432</sup></a> was committed,
      in such a fashion that your above-mentioned fellow-Bishops
      profaned everything which is most holy. They commanded the
      Eucharist to be cast to the dogs. This did not pass without
      evidence of the Divine Judgement, for these same dogs were
      inflamed with madness, and tore their own masters in pieces as
      though they had been murderers,<a href="#fn433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433" role="doc-noteref"><sup>433</sup></a> and attacked with avenging
      teeth those guilty of the Holy Body,<a href="#fn434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref434" role="doc-noteref"><sup>434</sup></a> as if they had been
      strangers and enemies.</p>
      <p>They also threw a phial of chrism out of a window, in order to
      break it, and although its fall was precipitated by violence, an
      angel’s hand was there to bring it down gently to earth, with the
      support that is from heaven. Though thrown away, it was not
      allowed to feel its fall, but, by the protection of God, found its
      home unbroken amongst the rocks.<a href="#fn435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435" role="doc-noteref"><sup>435</sup></a></p>
      <p>You never could have done such things as these, if you had
      borne in mind the Commands of Christ, who has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Give not that which is holy to dogs, and cast not your pearls
      before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turning
      rend you.’ <a href="#fn436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref436" role="doc-noteref"><sup>436</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Could the makers of Unity have done anything of a like nature,
      out of which you might labour to create a baseless prejudice
      against us Catholics? <a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437" role="doc-noteref"><sup>437</sup></a></p>
      <p>Urban of Forma and Felix of Idicra, when they came back, found
      that nuns whom they had seduced from their state of chastity had
      become mothers. Such, my brother Parmenian, is the character of
      the Bishops, whose deeds you cover up; and, when you ought to be
      blushing for your own sins, you bring charges against innocent
      Catholics.</p>
      <p>At this time the above-mentioned Bishop Felix, amongst his
      other crimes and horrible misdeeds, seized a young maiden to whom
      he himself had given the veil <a href="#fn438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref438" role="doc-noteref"><sup>438</sup></a> —by whom he had a short time
      before been called by the name of Father—and did not hesitate in
      the least to be guilty of shameless incest. And, as if, through
      his sin, he had been made holy, he went with haste to Tysedis!
      There he ventured to rob of the episcopal name and office and
      honour Donatus, a Bishop seventy years of age, against whom no
      charge could be brought. The Catholic Bishop was approached by the
      schismatic, the innocent by the guilty, the priest of God by one
      steeped in sacrilege, the chaste by the incestuous. The Bishop was
      attacked by one no longer a Bishop, who, relying upon the decrees
      and conspiracy of your party, and armed by your laws and your
      commands, cast those hands which a short time before had been made
      heavy by sins, upon the head of the innocent, and dared to let
      judgement fall from that tongue of his, which was not now worthy
      even to be allowed to do penance. See, my brother Parmenian, the
      sort of persons whom you defend; see the kind of men they are, on
      whose behalf you have, this long while, maintained that the
      Endowments of the Church are working.</p>
      <h3 id="it-is-proved-against-the-donatists-who-call-themselves-saints-that-no-man-can-be-free-from-sin.">It
      is proved against the Donatists, who call themselves saints, that
      no man can be free from sin.</h3>
      <p>Will you then—you who wish men to think you holy and
      innocent—tell me this—whence comes this sanctity of yours, which
      you too freely claim for yourselves—a sanctity which the Apostle
      John does not dare to profess, when he writes:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If we shall say that we are without sin we deceive ourselves
      and the truth is not in us.’ <a href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439" role="doc-noteref"><sup>439</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He who spoke thus kept himself, with wisdom, prepared for the
      grace of God.<a href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440" role="doc-noteref"><sup>440</sup></a> For it belongs to a
      Christian man to will what is good, and to run the course which he
      has rightly willed. But it is not given to man to bring to
      perfection; so that after the stages, which a man can go, there
      remains something for God with which He may meet man’s deficiency.
      For He alone is perfection; and perfect alone is Christ, the Son
      of God. We, the others, are all half-perfect <a href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref441" role="doc-noteref"><sup>441</sup></a>; for it is ours to will,<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442" role="doc-noteref"><sup>442</sup></a> it is ours to run, but it is
      God’s to make perfect. So the most blessed Apostle Paul has
      written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of
      him that reacheth to the grace of God.’ <a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443" role="doc-noteref"><sup>443</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For perfect sanctity has not been given, but promised, by
      Christ our Saviour. Thus He says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You shall be holy, because I am holy.’ <a href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444" role="doc-noteref"><sup>444</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So that He alone is perfect and holy. He did not say ‘You are
      holy’ but He did say</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You shall be holy.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>With what reason then do you, in your pride, claim for
      yourselves perfect holiness, except it be to make it clear that
      you deceive yourselves, and that the truth is not in you?</p>
      <p>You have been unwilling to live in the school of John,<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445" role="doc-noteref"><sup>445</sup></a> for, when you lead some
      astray, you promise them that you will grant them forgiveness of
      their sins; and, when you are pleased to forgive sins, you profess
      your own innocence and bestow forgiveness of sins, in such a
      manner as though you had no sin yourselves.<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446" role="doc-noteref"><sup>446</sup></a> This in you is not
      presumption <span>[</span>merely<span>]</span>; it is deception.
      This is not truth; it is a falsehood.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref447" role="doc-noteref"><sup>447</sup></a> For it is only a moment
      after <a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448" role="doc-noteref"><sup>448</sup></a> you have laid your hands
      upon the heads of others and pardoned their crimes, that you turn
      to the altar, and are unable to pass over the Lord’s Prayer. Then
      no doubt you say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Our Father who art in Heaven, forgive us our debts <a href="#fn449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref449" role="doc-noteref"><sup>449</sup></a> and sins.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What ought you to be called when you confess your own sins, if
      you are holy when you forgive the sins of others? In this way do
      you deceive yourselves, and the truth is not in you.</p>
      <p>But it is clear that this is dictated to you by your nursing
      mother Pride, as Christ bears witness in the Gospel. Although He
      did not mention your names, still He pointed out your character by
      a parable. For thus has it been written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Jesus spoke this parable on account of those who consider
      themselves holy and despise others.’ <a href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450" role="doc-noteref"><sup>450</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The evidence itself clearly shows that, when you puff
      yourselves up as holy, and plainly and openly despise us, this has
      been said of you. Two men, He said, went up into the Temple to
      pray, one a Pharisee and the other a Publican. The Pharisee
      swollen out, proud, puffed up, such as we see you too to be, his
      body not humbled, his neck not bent, but with raised countenance
      and swelling breast—cried aloud:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I give Thee thanks, my God, because in nothing have I
      sinned.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is to say to God:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I have nothing for Thee to pardon.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>O wildness of a madman! O pride that must be punished and
      condemned! <a href="#fn451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref451" role="doc-noteref"><sup>451</sup></a> God is prepared to pardon
      and the guilty one hastens to reject forgiveness. The Publican in
      his humility, recognising that he was a man, besought in this
      manner:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Have mercy, O Lord, on me a sinner.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus did he <a href="#fn452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref452" role="doc-noteref"><sup>452</sup></a> deserve to be justified;
      thus did pride go down from the Temple, condemned in the Pharisee
      —your teacher.</p>
      <p>More tolerable is it to find sins where there is humility, than
      innocence where there is pride.</p>
      <p>But you, though you are burdened with the heavy sins of
      Betrayal and Schism, take credit to yourselves that you are proud
      as well!</p>

      <p>Now that we have proved that you ought to blush with shame for
      those things at which you rejoice, and have shown with what mad
      rage you conducted yourselves in so many places, something should
      be said about the depth of your impiety. For who ever will be able
      to explain the crimes that have been done, or those that are being
      actually done, by you? It is clear that, with a certain wicked
      ingenuity, you arranged all your plans in such a way as by one bad
      action to accomplish different results. For example, when a priest
      or a Bishop was removed by you from his post,<a href="#fn453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref453" role="doc-noteref"><sup>453</sup></a> you saw to it that you might
      capture all his flock. How could a mass of men stand firm when
      they saw you tear their ruler from them? In this manner is it
      always that, after the shepherd has by some misfortune been
      killed, wolves set upon the sheep. You exorcised the Faithful, and
      without reason washed the walls of the churches, that by
      wickedness of this kind you might undermine the minds of very
      simple people.<a href="#fn454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref454" role="doc-noteref"><sup>454</sup></a> By such evil designs as
      these you throttled the intelligence of not a few,<a href="#fn455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref455" role="doc-noteref"><sup>455</sup></a> and having disguised the
      light of your cunning by covering it all under a cloud <a href="#fn456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref456" role="doc-noteref"><sup>456</sup></a> of feigned simplicity, you
      shot arrows from your quiver, to lay low the miserable by the
      seductions that your hearts contrived. Even as the Holy Ghost
      foretold of you, through David the Prophet, in the Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘For lo the wicked have bent their bow, they have prepared the
      arrows in their quiver to shoot the upright of heart when the moon
      is dark.’ <a href="#fn457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref457" role="doc-noteref"><sup>457</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In what way have your deeds fallen short of your plans? You
      have shot the innocent, you have disarmed the faithful. Bishops
      have been stripped of the office belonging to their title. O
      unheard-of impiety, upon whom have you laid your cut-throat hands,
      to keep them amongst the torments of Penance <a href="#fn458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref458" role="doc-noteref"><sup>458</sup></a>?</p>
      <p>The savagery of highway robbers is seen to be a thing of less
      account, when compared with the deeds that you have done. The
      robber gives those whom he murders a quick death; you slay your
      victim, yet leave him amongst the living.<a href="#fn459" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref459" role="doc-noteref"><sup>459</sup></a> Those whom you have

      <p>It is clear, therefore, that of you it has been written in the

      <blockquote>

      <p>‘Justice looking down from heaven’ <a href="#fn464" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref464" role="doc-noteref"><sup>464</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>accuses you; whilst on earth men praise you with mistaken
      praise for doing wickedness, so that of you the Holy Ghost has
      said in the ninth Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor man is set on fire;
      they are caught in the counsels which they devise. The sinner is
      praised in the desires of his soul and he who does iniquity shall
      be blessed.’ <a href="#fn465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref465" role="doc-noteref"><sup>465</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What greater iniquity than yours can there be found to be
      praised? What is there more iniquitous than to exorcise the Holy
      Ghost, to break down altars, to cast the Eucharist to animals? Yet
      your people praise you and—thus do they plunge you into folly—call
      you fortunate, and name you for good luck, <a href="#fn466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref466" role="doc-noteref"><sup>466</sup></a> and swear by your name, and
      so are seen already to treat your persons as though you were

      Impiety of the Donatists, who were accustomed to swear by their
      Bishops.</h3>
      <p>Men are accustomed to use the Name of God when they swear, as a
      pledge of their truthfulness, but your party, when they swear by
      you, keep silence about God and Christ. If the worship due to God
      has passed from Heaven to you (as would seem from the fact that
      men swear by you), then let none of you or your party fall sick!
      Then refuse to die; give orders to the clouds: draw down the rain,
      if you can, that they may swear even more freely in your name, and
      may keep silence about God. For what could the Devil effect more
      by the hands of your people, than he did in the ages that are
      past, when he caused his temples to be built and his idols to be
      fashioned—excepting this, that silence should be kept about God,
      whilst men in their foolishness speak of him alone.</p>
      <h3 id="the-wickedness-of-the-donatists-in-scraping-the-heads-of-anointed-priests.">The
      wickedness of the Donatists in scraping the heads of anointed
      priests.</h3>
      <p>O sacrilege heaped upon impiety! You gladly listen to men
      swearing by you, but refuse your ears to the voice of God in the
      hundred and fourth Psalm, when He says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Touch not Mine Anointed and cast not your hands on My
      prophets.’ <a href="#fn467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref467" role="doc-noteref"><sup>467</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That both kings and priests are God’s Anointed is shown by the
      books of Kings and also by David, saying in the hundred and
      thirty-second Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘As the precious ointment on the head, that ran down unto the
      beard of Aaron.’ <a href="#fn468" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref468" role="doc-noteref"><sup>468</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You, on the contrary, have striven against God to despise His
      precepts, as earnestly as they who fear God strive to keep His
      Commandments. Tell us, where is your authority for scraping the
      heads of priests,<a href="#fn469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref469" role="doc-noteref"><sup>469</sup></a> when there are
      so many examples to the contrary, showing that this may not be
      done? Saul, before he sinned, received the grace of being
      anointed.<a href="#fn470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470" role="doc-noteref"><sup>470</sup></a> After his anointing, he
      sinned grievously. God, when He saw this, wishing to give us an
      example not to touch the Oil, professed His repentance. For we
      read that the Lord spoke thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘It repenteth Me to have anointed Saul to be a king.’ <a href="#fn471" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref471" role="doc-noteref"><sup>471</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yet surely God might have taken away the Oil which He had
      bestowed; but, since He wished to teach that the Oil should not be
      touched even in a sinner, He who had given it, declared that it
      repented Him. If then God, in order to teach you, could not
      (because He would not) take away that which He had given, who are
      you to take away what you did not give?</p>
      <p>And when you ought to have opened your ears to listen, you
      prepared your razor for sin. When you ought to have been the sons
      of God, you preferred to be the sons of men, and, in order to bite
      into other men’s offices, turned your teeth into arrows and arms.
      You sharpened your tongues into swords; you fulfilled that which
      was written of you in the fifty-sixth Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Sons of men—their teeth are arms and arrows; their tongue is a
      sharp sword.’ <a href="#fn472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref472" role="doc-noteref"><sup>472</sup></a></p>

      destroyed not their members, but their titles. What boots it for
      those to live, who have been slain by you in their office? Their
      members are indeed whole and sound, but they carry about the
      corpse of the dignity which you have scratched away. For you
      stretched forth your hand and placed the death-bearing Veils upon
      every head; so that whilst there are (as I have said above) four
      kinds of heads in the Church—Bishops, priests, deacons, and the

      Oil bestowed by God upon a Bishop, you ought to have learnt from
      David the servant of God, who was anointed by Samuel, with the
      condition that what had already been given to Saul, should by no
      means be taken away.<a href="#fn482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref482" role="doc-noteref"><sup>482</sup></a> When, through
      the command, or the providence, of God, they were shut up together
      in one cave, Saul, who had sinned, came into the power of the
      youth David. Saul, although he sees not, is seen, because (as
      usually happens to one that passes from the light of day) he was
      not able, in the darkness of the shut-in-air,<a href="#fn483" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref483" role="doc-noteref"><sup>483</sup></a> to see the other who was
      near him. A great army followed the old king. Still he had fallen
      into the power of another. David had the chance of victory in his
      hands. Without effort he might have slain his incautious adversary
      who was wrapt in security. Without bloodshed, and the clash of
      arms, he might have summarily changed war into slaughter. The
      opportunity was there. His soldiers were in favour of this course.
      The situation urged him on to snatch a victory. Already he
      commenced to draw his sword. His armed hand was now reaching for
      his enemy’s throat. But the remembrance of the divine commands
      completely blocked the way. He fought against the persuasion of
      his soldiers, and resisted the fitness of the circumstances, as if
      he had said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘To no purpose, O Victory, dost thou tempt me; in vain, O
      opportunity, dost thou lure me on to triumphs!’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He wished to conquer his foe, but desired even more to keep the
      commands of the Lord.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I will not,’ he said, ‘lay my hands upon the Lord’s anointed.’
      <a href="#fn484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref484" role="doc-noteref"><sup>484</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He checked his hand and his sword—he feared to violate the Oil;
      he saved his enemy; and, that he might accomplish his duty towards
      his King to the end, after his death took up his defence. <a href="#fn485" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref485" role="doc-noteref"><sup>485</sup></a></p>
      <p>You neither fear God, nor regard those who are your brethren.
      You have sharpened the razors of your tongue upon the whetstone of
      your malice, and, trampling underfoot the precepts of Heaven, have
      rushed upon the heads of miserable men, that, after you had slain
      their leaders, you might drag them in their blindness and
      ignorance into bondage. You hunger after the dignities of innocent
      priests, with a hunger so furious that you have made open
      sepulchres of your throats. For each separate sepulchre one
      funeral is enough, and then it is closed. For your throats many
      funerals of many dignities have not by any means been enough. They
      still remain open, seeking whom they may devour. So that with
      reason was it said of you:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>If any man has done anything against your will, you threaten
      him with horrors and foul menaces; and then, since some there are
      who deserve more evil than good, you attribute to your bitter
      curses whatever has befallen them from the Judgement of God, or is
      the just result of their sins. With reason was it said of you in
      the thirteenth Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.’ <a href="#fn488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref488" role="doc-noteref"><sup>488</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You boast that some men have been known to die after you have
      cursed them.</p>
      <p>It is certain that it is not lawful to kill. On this account do
      you hold yourselves innocent, merely because you have not used
      cold steel? If there be no murder without steel, the poisoner,
      also, may judge himself to be innocent; and a man need not deem
      himself guilty who has killed another by withdrawing his food; he
      also, then, may claim to be guiltless who smothers his
      victim—still clinging to life—by stifling his breath. Of murders
      there are many kinds, but the name of Death is one. Thou dost
      declare with confidence that a man has died through thy curses.
      What difference does it make whether thou smitest him with the
      sword, or dost strike him with the tongue? Beyond doubt thou art a
      murderer, if a man, who was alive, has met his death through
      thee.</p>
      <p>Whoever of thy party has thus acted professes in vain that he
      is a Christian, or a priest of God, for he takes no care to
      imitate the Mildness of God, though it is written in Solomon <a href="#fn489" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref489" role="doc-noteref"><sup>489</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>I do not believe that you are able to forget the crimes that
      you have committed throughout several districts, where you set to
      work to slay those who were preaching the Law of God, that is to
      say, His Prophets, contrary to His command, who says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Lay not your hands upon My Prophets.’ <a href="#fn491" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref491" role="doc-noteref"><sup>491</sup></a></p>

      <p>Deuterius, Partenius, Donatus and Getulicus, Bishops of God,

      their body, but of their dignity. Afterwards they still lived, but
      were slain by you in their dignities—they who were Priests of
      God.</p>
      <p>It is known to many (and has been proved) that in the time of
      persecution some Bishops fell away through cowardice from the
      confession of the Name of God, and offered incense to idols. But
      never did any one of those who remained faithful either place his
      hand <span>[</span>in Penance<span>]</span> upon the fallen, or

      <p>God avenges the Oil which is His own, for the sin belongs to

      with you for their instructors, whilst they still remained in
      possession of their innocence and modesty. Is this a small
      unhappiness? You have destroyed both sexes; you have harassed all
      ages. Truly of you has it been said in the thirteenth Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Destruction and unhappiness are in their ways, and the way of

      <p>You have prescribed Penance for the people. It was not
      performed voluntarily by any man, but it was enforced by you, nor
      did you inflict it equally, for the same periods of time, but
      arranged everything with respect of persons. By your command one
      person did Penance for a whole year, another for a month, yet
      another for hardly a day.</p>
      <p>If to consent to unity is (as you will have it) a sin, if it is
      the same fault in all, why is there not the same Penance for the
      same guilt?</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that the people who believe have been called
      Israel, and that the Faithful, one by one, are the daughters of
      Israel, that is, those who see God with their mind,<a href="#fn497" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref497" role="doc-noteref"><sup>497</sup></a> and have faith in God. Yet
      you have compelled these people to bend and incline their necks,

      severities against the Donatists were provoked by themselves, and
      Catholics ought not to be blamed for them.</h3>
      <p>I have written in my second Book (as I think, at sufficient
      length) concerning the Church, which is the Bride of Christ, and
      about her Endowments, and of the Saviour’s inheritance. It remains
      for me to show, in the first place, the errors of the schismatics;
      secondly, to point out how it came to pass that unity was
      enforced; and thirdly, to prove who brought it about that an armed
      force was sent.</p>
      <p>That much severity was shown by the makers of unity cannot be
      denied. But why impute this to Leontius, Macarius or Taurinus <a href="#fn499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref499" role="doc-noteref"><sup>499</sup></a>? Ascribe it rather to your
      own ancestors, who, as the prophet has written, ‘have themselves
      eaten sour grapes, that your teeth may be set on edge.’ <a href="#fn500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref500" role="doc-noteref"><sup>500</sup></a></p>
      <p>They are primarily responsible, who divided the people of God
      and built basilicas which were not wanted.<a href="#fn501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501" role="doc-noteref"><sup>501</sup></a></p>
      <p>Secondly, Donatus of Carthage ought to be blamed, for it was in
      consequence of his appeal <a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502" role="doc-noteref"><sup>502</sup></a> that an
      attempt was made to enforce unity at the next opportunity.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, Donatus of Bagaia, who got together a mob of madmen,
      so that Macarius asked for the help of an armed force, in order to
      protect himself and the interests which had been committed to his

      Unity was proclaimed. There were merely exhortations that the
      people should assemble in one place, to pray together to God and
      His Christ. At first there were no threats <a href="#fn506" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref506" role="doc-noteref"><sup>506</sup></a>; no one had seen a weapon or

      <p>It was not therefore on this Mount Sion that Isaiah beheld the

      reared her head throughout all the Roman world, beneath the whole
      expanse of Heaven.</p>
      <p>This is the mountain on which the Son of God rejoices that He

      beloved by God, but on the mount, by which the Church is
      spiritually signified. The gates of this Church are entered by the
      innocent, the just and the merciful, by the pure of heart, and the
      virgins. These are the gates of which the Holy Ghost makes
      mention, through David, in the eighty-sixth Psalm, when He
      says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Her foundations are upon the holy hills; the Lord loveth the
      Gates of Sion’ <a href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>540</sup></a> —</p>

      triumphs of the Emperor Vespasian, there are no gates, and scarce
      any traces of its ancient ruins are to be found.</p>
      <p>Wherefore, the spiritual Sion is the Church, in which Christ
      was made King by God the Father—that is in the whole world, where
      there is One Catholic Church . . . for the most holy prophet David
      bears witness in another place also that Sion is the Church:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Laud thy God, O Sion, for he hath made fast the bars of thy
      gates. He hath blessed thy children within thee.’ <a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref542" role="doc-noteref"><sup>542</sup></a></p>

      <p>We understand the various provinces of the whole world to
      represent the various valleys of the mountain.<a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref543" role="doc-noteref"><sup>543</sup></a> And since Isaiah had not his
      vision of the whole mountain, but of one valley, that means in

      Africa alone walls were cast down, and in order that walls might

      <p>This has happened in Africa alone, and God pointed out for what
      reason all this was done, blaming you with these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Because <a href="#fn555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555" role="doc-noteref"><sup>555</sup></a> you have diverted the water

      created it in the beginning.’ <a href="#fn556" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref556" role="doc-noteref"><sup>556</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So you see, my brother Parmenian, that you, by whose first
      fathers the seed of all these things was sown, find yourselves
      burdened with the crop.</p>
      <h3 id="the-pride-of-donatus.">The pride of Donatus.</h3>
      <p>Secondly, Donatus of Carthage was responsible, for through his
      poisonous wiles <a href="#fn557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref557" role="doc-noteref"><sup>557</sup></a> the question
      of <span>[</span>effecting<span>]</span> unity was first
      mooted.</p>
      <p>I shall be able to show that the makers of unity did nothing at
      our instigation, nor of their own wickedness, but that everything
      happened through provocatory causes, which were set in motion by
      Donatus of Carthage, in his lightness of heart, and were due to
      the actions of individuals controlled by him, whilst he was
      struggling to be thought great. Is there anyone that can be
      ignorant of all this excepting yourself; for, since you were a
      stranger,<a href="#fn558" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>558</sup></a> they have been able to get
      you to believe idle fables?</p>
      <p>Again, who can deny a fact, to which the whole of Carthage is
      the leading witness, that the Emperor Constans did not originally
      send Paul and Macarius to bring about unity, but to be his
      almoner, in order that the poor people <a href="#fn559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref559" role="doc-noteref"><sup>559</sup></a> in the various churches
      might be afforded assistance, by means of which they might breathe
      anew, be clothed, fed, and rejoice?</p>
      <p>But when they came to Donatus, your father, and told him why
      they had come, he, as was usual with him, fell into a rage, and
      burst out with these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘What has the Emperor to do with the Church?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And, from the fountain of his levity, he poured forth torrents
      of reproaches no less evil-sounding than those with which he had
      once upon a time not hesitated to assail the prefect
      Gregory—calling him ‘Gregory, the stain upon the Senate, the
      disgrace of Prefects,’ and the like. Gregory replied to him with
      patience worthy of a Bishop.<a href="#fn560" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref560" role="doc-noteref"><sup>560</sup></a> Copies of
      these letters exist and are in the mouths of many chanted
      everywhere.<a href="#fn561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref561" role="doc-noteref"><sup>561</sup></a> Then Donatus—against the
      commands of the Apostle Paul—planned to do a wrong to those in
      high places, and to kings,<a href="#fn562" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref562" role="doc-noteref"><sup>562</sup></a> on behalf of
      whom, if he had listened to the Apostle, he would have prayed
      every day, since this is the teaching of the blessed Apostle
      Paul:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Pray for kings and for powers, that with them we may lead a
      quiet and tranquil life.’ <a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref563" role="doc-noteref"><sup>563</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For the State is not in the Church, but the Church is in the
      State, that is to say, in the Roman Empire,<a href="#fn564" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564" role="doc-noteref"><sup>564</sup></a> which Christ calls Libanus
      in the Canticle of Canticles, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Come, my spouse, whom I have found,<a href="#fn565" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref565" role="doc-noteref"><sup>565</sup></a> come from Libanus,’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>that is to say, from the Roman Empire, where are the holy
      offices of the priesthood,<a href="#fn566" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref566" role="doc-noteref"><sup>566</sup></a> and modesty
      and virginity, which exist not amongst foreign peoples,<a href="#fn567" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref567" role="doc-noteref"><sup>567</sup></a> and which, if they did
      exist, could not be safe from outrage. With reason does Paul teach
      us that we must pray for kings and powers, even though the Emperor
      be living a pagan life.<a href="#fn568" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref568" role="doc-noteref"><sup>568</sup></a> How much more,
      then, if he be a Christian—how much more if he fears God, and is
      pious, and full of mercy, as facts prove this one <a href="#fn569" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref569" role="doc-noteref"><sup>569</sup></a> to have been?</p>
      <p>For he had sent ornaments to the Houses of God, he had sent
      alms for the poor, nothing to Donatus <a href="#fn570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref570" role="doc-noteref"><sup>570</sup></a>! Why, then, did Donatus act
      like a madman? Why was he full of anger? Why did he refuse the
      gifts which had been sent? For when the commissioners announced
      that they were going through the different provinces, and that
      they would give alms to those who were Mailing to accept them, he
      declared that he had sent letters everywhere in advance to forbid
      that anything which had been brought should be distributed
      anywhere amongst the poor. Oh, this is the way to console the
      wretched, to provide for the needs of the poor, to come to the aid
      of sinners! God cries out:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘It is I who have made both the rich man and the poor man.’ <a href="#fn571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref571" role="doc-noteref"><sup>571</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Not that He was unable to give to the poor man also. But, if He
      had given to the poor as well as to the rich, the sinner would not
      be able to discover any means of helping himself. On this account
      has it been written that:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Even as water puts out a fire, so do alms-deeds wipe out sin.’
      <a href="#fn572" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref572" role="doc-noteref"><sup>572</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is certain that both are now with God—the one who wished to
      give, and the other who stood in the way of his giving. Well, if
      God were now to say to Donatus ‘O Bishop, what do you wish to make
      out Constants to have been? If he was innocent, why would you not
      receive from an innocent giver? If he was a sinner, why did you
      not permit aims to be given by him, for whose sake I made the poor
      man?’ When questioned after this fashion, what sort of face will
      he show? Why in his levity and madness did he work so hard to keep
      good things from so many <a href="#fn573" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref573" role="doc-noteref"><sup>573</sup></a> poor
      people?</p>
      <p>He believed that he held dominion over Carthage; and since
      there is no one superior to the Emperor excepting God alone (who
      made the Emperor), Donatus, in raising himself above the Emperor,
      had already, as it were, passed the boundaries apportioned to
      humanity, so that he almost regarded himself, not as man, but as
      God, when he refused to revere him, who, after God, was feared by
      mankind.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel,
      rebukes the prince of Tyre, that is to say, the prince of
      Carthage, with these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘O Son of man, speak against the prince of Tyre, saith the Lord
      God, because thine heart has been puffed up, and thou hast said I
      am God.’ <a href="#fn574" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref574" role="doc-noteref"><sup>574</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That Tyre is Carthage is shown, in the first place, by Isaiah,
      when, after describing the vision of Tyre, he goes on:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Howl, O ye ships of Carthage.’ <a href="#fn575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref575" role="doc-noteref"><sup>575</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the second place this is also proved by profane
      literature,<a href="#fn576" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>576</sup></a> and, if there be any other
      city called by this name, there is no other in which any of those
      things were done which are known to have been done at
      Carthage.</p>
      <p>‘Speak,’ says the Lord, ‘against the prince of Tyre.’ He does
      not command the prophet to speak against any secular king,<a href="#fn577" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref577" role="doc-noteref"><sup>577</sup></a> nor was he to speak to many,
      but to one—that is to Donatus, Bishop of Carthage. For it was not
      fitting for Ezekiel, whose words I have just quoted,<a href="#fn578" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref578" role="doc-noteref"><sup>578</sup></a> to compare to any man,
      excepting to a prince, that Bishop who claimed for himself (as we
      have said) princedom over Carthage, who puffed up his heart, and
      thought himself to be superior to men and wished to have even all
      his own colleagues beneath him—from whose offerings he would never
      deign to accept aught. Now, his conscience, and Christ his God
      bear witness to this—and the complaints of many.<a href="#fn579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref579" role="doc-noteref"><sup>579</sup></a> For in his very intercourse
      with others, he did them this wrong, that he acted in some secret
      way or other, alone by himself, and afterwards only in a
      perfunctory manner <a href="#fn580" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref580" role="doc-noteref"><sup>580</sup></a> mingled with
      the rest.</p>
      <p>In this fashion was his heart puffed up, so that in the end he
      seemed to himself no longer to be man, but God.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in the mouths of the people he was seldom called a
      Bishop, but was spoken of as ‘Donatus of Carthage.’ And deservedly
      was he both addressed and chided as Prince of Tyre (that is of
      Carthage), because he was the first of the Bishops,<a href="#fn581" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref581" role="doc-noteref"><sup>581</sup></a> as though he were something
      more than the rest. And whilst he wished to have nothing common to
      mankind,<a href="#fn582" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref582" role="doc-noteref"><sup>582</sup></a> he lifted up his heart, not
      like the heart of a man, but like the heart of a god,<a href="#fn583" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref583" role="doc-noteref"><sup>583</sup></a> since he desired to be
      something more than other men.<a href="#fn584" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref584" role="doc-noteref"><sup>584</sup></a></p>
      <p>But God follows after Donatus with these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou hast said, I am God.’ <a href="#fn585" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref585" role="doc-noteref"><sup>585</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For though he did not make use of this expression, still he
      either himself accomplished, or suffered, that which would bring
      about its result.<a href="#fn586" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref586" role="doc-noteref"><sup>586</sup></a> He puffed up
      his heart in such a way as to think that no other man ought to be
      compared with him, and, in the swelling of his own mind, he seemed
      to himself to be something higher than the others. Since whatever
      is above men, in a sort of way is God.<a href="#fn587" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref587" role="doc-noteref"><sup>587</sup></a></p>
      <p>Besides, whereas Bishops ought to serve God, he demanded so
      much for himself from his Bishops, that they all had to venerate
      him with no less fear than they venerated God—because to himself
      he seemed to be God. And though men are wont to swear by God
      alone, he allowed men to swear by him, as if by God. If this were
      done by any man in mistake, it was his duty to forbid it. As,
      then, he did not forbid it, to himself he seemed to be God. Again,
      whilst all those who believed in Christ were, before the day of
      his insolence, called Christians, he ventured to divide the people
      with God, so that those who followed him were no longer called
      Christians, but Donatists, and when any people visited him from
      any province of Africa, he did not ask those questions (which the
      custom of men always calls for) about the weather, about peace and
      war, about the harvest, but to everyone who came into his
      presence, he spoke thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘How goes my party in your part of the world?’ <a href="#fn588" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref588" role="doc-noteref"><sup>588</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As though he had now really divided the people with God, so
      that, without faltering, he dared to call it his ‘party.’ For,
      from his time to the present day, whenever any action is brought
      before the public courts on ecclesiastical affairs; all
      <span>[</span>of his sect<span>]</span> have, on being questioned
      (as we read in the records of the proceedings), spoken in such a
      way as to assert that they belong to the party of Donatus.
      Concerning Christ they kept silence. And what am I to say of their
      clergy, when I read the petition which (as I have stated in the
      first book <a href="#fn589" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref589" role="doc-noteref"><sup>589</sup></a>) was sent to Constantine,
      subscribed by Bishops in this manner: ‘Given by Capito and by
      Nasutius, Dignus, and the other Bishops of the party of Donatus’?
      <a href="#fn590" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref590" role="doc-noteref"><sup>590</sup></a> They, we know, made their
      complaints against Bishops, who, whilst they did not belong to the
      party of Donatus, dwelt in the Catholic Church of Christ.<a href="#fn591" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591" role="doc-noteref"><sup>591</sup></a></p>
      <p>Since, then, Donatus did not live as a Bishop amongst his
      fellow-Bishops, and refused to be a man amongst men, it is certain
      that he puffed up his heart and seemed to himself to be God. And
      as for the Bishops by whom you were consecrated, their names, my
      brother Parmenian, are well known to you, and you know also where
      they lived, and which of them made a petition to return home—in
      your company. You know, too, who it was to whom they made this
      petition, and you know his character.<a href="#fn592" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref592" role="doc-noteref"><sup>592</sup></a> Now, all this we have
      learned through their having brought before the judges in Africa
      this same old petition in which they had written: ‘Given by the
      Bishops of the party of Donatus.’ <a href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref593" role="doc-noteref"><sup>593</sup></a></p>
      <p>What reply, I ask, will they make in the approaching Judgement
      of God, since they in this world acknowledged equivalently <a href="#fn594" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref594" role="doc-noteref"><sup>594</sup></a> that they belonged, not to
      the Church of Christ, but freely confessed that they were of the
      party of Donatus, though it is written in the Gospel that Christ
      has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He that confesses Me before men, him will I confess before My
      Father’? <a href="#fn595" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref595" role="doc-noteref"><sup>595</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These men confessed, not Christ, but Donatus.</p>
      <p>That the evidence by which clearly to identify the person of
      Donatus might be by no means scanty there is yet another proof,
      with which the above-mentioned accusation was closed. God had said
      that Donatus <a href="#fn596" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref596" role="doc-noteref"><sup>596</sup></a> would not die upon the
      earth.<a href="#fn597" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref597" role="doc-noteref"><sup>597</sup></a> That this is the case is
      known to all. He dwelt in the house of God, but lived in the heart
      of the sea. We read that the sea always signifies the world. It
      was not enough for him to be beloved by some Christian people,
      but, by reason of his acquaintance with worldly letters, he was
      also in the heart of the sea, that is, was beloved by the world,<a href="#fn598" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref598" role="doc-noteref"><sup>598</sup></a> and on account of his
      knowledge seemed to himself to be wise. But of this wisdom of his
      God made little,<a href="#fn599" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref599" role="doc-noteref"><sup>599</sup></a> saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Art thou more wise than Daniel?’ <a href="#fn600" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref600" role="doc-noteref"><sup>600</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>With how great reason, and how well, has been humbled that
      wisdom of his, which made him think himself wiser than was Daniel
      (when he refused the gifts of the King), and would not accept that
      which had been sent by a Christian Emperor. And he seemed to
      himself to be a new Daniel, or to have been raised above Daniel in
      wisdom, for we read that Daniel, when he was once required to
      receive presents from King Balthassar—a ring; a chain and the
      rest—answered thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thy gifts to thyself, O King.’ <a href="#fn601" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref601" role="doc-noteref"><sup>601</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He answered with wisdom, and did not hurl abuse at the King,
      and did not blame him for what he offered, but put the matter off
      for a while.</p>
      <p>Quite otherwise Donatus, who both spoke to Constans as abusive
      words as he knew how, and refused what had been destined for the
      poor. We can see the wisdom of holy Daniel in not accepting that
      day the gifts that were offered him. For the question that they
      asked him was still <span>[</span>known only<span>]</span> in
      Heaven, and it would have been the act of a fool to receive any
      kind of reward for that which he had not yet in his power to
      reveal. Therefore he was for the time unwilling to accept these
      presents. Afterwards, when God showed him what he should say to
      the King, he told it to Balthassar, and, later on, gladly accepted
      that which he was known formerly to have rejected.<a href="#fn602" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref602" role="doc-noteref"><sup>602</sup></a> Deservedly, therefore, does
      God rebuke the Prince of Tyre (that is Donatus), when He asks
      him:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Art thou more wise than Daniel?’ <a href="#fn603" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref603" role="doc-noteref"><sup>603</sup></a><br />
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But oh! how far removed is the presumption of Donatus from the
      character of Daniel! For what Balthassar gave, he gave to Daniel,
      not to the poor; but that which Constans, the Christian Emperor,
      had sent, he had sent to the poor, not to Donatus.</p>
      <p>So to Donatus God said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The wise men have not taught thee their wisdom’ <a href="#fn604" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref604" role="doc-noteref"><sup>604</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>for thou hast refused to learn from the words of Solomon:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Hide thy bread in the heart of the poor man, and he shall pray
      for thee.’ <a href="#fn605" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref605" role="doc-noteref"><sup>605</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Moreover, he would not learn from Daniel himself the lesson
      which Daniel gave to Nebuchadnezzar, as to how one who had
      offended God might make satisfaction:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘And do thou, O King,’ he said, ‘hear my advice, and may it
      find favour in thy sight. Redeem thy sins by alms-deeds, and the
      unjust things that thou hast done by having compassion upon the
      poor.’ <a href="#fn606" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref606" role="doc-noteref"><sup>606</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Daniel advised a king, who was a sinner and sacrilegious, to
      give alms. Donatus, who has deserved to be blamed,<a href="#fn607" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref607" role="doc-noteref"><sup>607</sup></a> hindered Constans, a
      Christian Emperor, from doing deeds of mercy. Therefore is he
      blameworthy, because wise men have not taught him their wisdom,<a href="#fn608" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref608" role="doc-noteref"><sup>608</sup></a> for he did not suffer the
      gifts sent by this King to be distributed through his hands.</p>
      <p>From all these things it is certain that Donatus was the
      fountain from which flowed the causes of the evils which ensued.<a href="#fn609" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref609" role="doc-noteref"><sup>609</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="an-account-of-violent-deeds-done-by-donatists-against-donatists.">An
      account of violent deeds done by Donatists against Donatists.</h3>
      <p>So, you see, my brother Parmenian, to whose charge any severity
      that may have occurred in the work of bringing about unity ought
      to be attributed. You say that an armed force was asked for by us
      Catholics. If so, how is it that no one at that time ever saw an
      armed soldier in the proconsular Province?</p>
      <p>Paul and Macarius came in order to console the poor
      everywhere,<a href="#fn610" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref610" role="doc-noteref"><sup>610</sup></a> and exhort everyone
      individually <a href="#fn611" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref611" role="doc-noteref"><sup>611</sup></a> to unity. But when they drew
      near to the city of Bagaia, then it was that the second Donatus <a href="#fn612" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref612" role="doc-noteref"><sup>612</sup></a> (as we have already written)
      who was the Bishop of that city, in his desire to oppose an
      obstacle to unity, and to place a check in the way of the
      above-mentioned legates of the Emperor, sent his heralds through
      the neighbourhood, and especially to all the fairs, and called
      upon his fighting dervishes <a href="#fn613" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref613" role="doc-noteref"><sup>613</sup></a> to come in a
      body to a place which he had fixed for them. So it was that at
      that juncture those men were called together, whose madness had
      been deemed by these same Bishops, only a short time previously,
      to have been set on fire by their wickedness.</p>
      <p>For when men of this sort were, before the attainment of unity,
      wandering about in every place, and in their insanity called Axido
      and Fasir ‘Captains of the Saints,’ no man could rest secure in
      his possessions. Written acknowledgments of indebtedness had lost
      their value. At that time no creditor was free to press his claim,
      and all were terrified by the letters of these fellows, who
      boasted that they were ‘Captains of the Saints.’ If there was any
      delay in obeying their commands, of a sudden a host of madmen flew
      to the place. A reign of terror was established. Creditors were
      hemmed in with perils, so that they who had a right to be
      supplicated on account of that which was due to them, were driven,
      through fear of death, to be themselves the humble suppliants.
      Very soon everyone lost what was owing to him—even to very large
      amounts, and held himself to have gained something in escaping
      from the violence of these men.</p>
      <p>Even journeys could not be made with perfect safety, for
      masters were often thrown out of their own chariots and forced to
      run, in servile fashion, in front of their own slaves, seated in
      their lord’s place. By the judgement and command of these outlaws,
      the condition of masters and slaves was completely reversed.</p>
      <p>So when the Bishops of your party were reproached
      <span>[</span>with this state of affairs<span>]</span>, they are
      said to have written to Taurinus, who was at the time in
      possession of civil authority,<a href="#fn614" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref614" role="doc-noteref"><sup>614</sup></a> saying that as men of this
      class could not be corrected by the Church,<a href="#fn615" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref615" role="doc-noteref"><sup>615</sup></a> they requested that they
      should be punished <a href="#fn616" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref616" role="doc-noteref"><sup>616</sup></a> by the
      above-mentioned officer.</p>
      <p>In answer to this letter Taurinus ordered an armed force to go
      through the fairs, where these mad vagrants were accustomed to
      wander about.</p>
      <p>In the district round Octavum <a href="#fn617" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref617" role="doc-noteref"><sup>617</sup></a> a large number were put to
      death, of whom many were beheaded. Even to the present day we may
      count their bodies by the whitened altars or tables.<a href="#fn618" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref618" role="doc-noteref"><sup>618</sup></a> When the custom was
      introduced of burying some in the basilicas, the priest Clarus <a href="#fn619" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref619" role="doc-noteref"><sup>619</sup></a> in the district of Subula
      was required by his Bishop to undo the burial.<a href="#fn620" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref620" role="doc-noteref"><sup>620</sup></a> Through this it came to be
      known that what was done had been done through a command,<a href="#fn621" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref621" role="doc-noteref"><sup>621</sup></a> when not even burial in the
      House of God was permitted them.</p>
      <p>Afterwards the numbers of these fanatics had once more
      increased; so Donatus of Bagaia found the means of getting
      together from them a furious horde with which to oppose
      Macarius.</p>
      <p>Of the same class were those who, out of desire for a false
      martyrdom, hired men to strike and kill them to their own
      destruction.<a href="#fn622" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref622" role="doc-noteref"><sup>622</sup></a> From amongst these also they
      were drawn who cast themselves down headlong from the summits of
      lofty mountains, throwing away their good-for-nothing lives.<a href="#fn623" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref623" role="doc-noteref"><sup>623</sup></a></p>
      <p>See the character of these men, from whom a Bishop, the second
      Donatus, provided himself with cohorts!</p>
      <p>Alarmed, then, at this state of terror, those who had brought
      the treasure to distribute amongst the poor, conceived the plan,
      in such extreme necessity, of asking for soldiers from the Prefect
      <a href="#fn624" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref624" role="doc-noteref"><sup>624</sup></a> Silvester, not to do
      violence to anyone, but to put an end to the violence which had
      been arranged by the above-mentioned Bishop Donatus.</p>
      <p>In this way did it come to pass that soldiers were seen in
      arms. Now, consider to whom it is right, or possible, to attribute
      that which followed afterwards. The fanatics had got together an
      enormous horde, and it is known that they had prepared an ample
      commissariat.<a href="#fn625" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref625" role="doc-noteref"><sup>625</sup></a> They had turned a basilica
      into a sort of public granary, where they awaited those upon whom
      they might expend their savagery; and they would have done
      whatever their madness might have urged, had not the presence of
      an armed force stood in their way.</p>
      <p>For, when quartermasters <a href="#fn626" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref626" role="doc-noteref"><sup>626</sup></a> were, as is
      usual, sent ahead of the soldiers, they were not received with due
      respect <a href="#fn627" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref627" role="doc-noteref"><sup>627</sup></a>—contrary to the command of
      the Apostle, who says</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Honour to whom honour is due, custom to whom custom, tribute
      to whom tribute. Owe no man anything.’ <a href="#fn628" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref628" role="doc-noteref"><sup>628</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Those who had been sent on horseback were maltreated by the men
      whose names you have blown about with the fan of hatred.<a href="#fn629" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref629" role="doc-noteref"><sup>629</sup></a> They were the authors of
      their own wrongs, and. by their example, through the injuries
      which they inflicted upon others, brought upon themselves whatever
      sufferings they may have endured. The soldiers who had been thus
      molested went back to their quarters,<a href="#fn630" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref630" role="doc-noteref"><sup>630</sup></a> and everyone resented that
      which two or three had endured. All were profoundly stirred up,
      and not even their officers could hold back these soldiers in
      their anger. In this way that came to pass, which you have
      recorded thus, to create prejudice against unity. These events,
      and others which you have mentioned, have their own causes, and
      the persons whose names I have given are responsible. <em>We</em>
      have not even seen them, though we have heard of them, just as you
      have done.</p>
      <p>If to have heard of a thing makes us guilty, we hold you to be
      partners of our guilt, since you have heard of it likewise; if to
      know of a thing by hearing gives freedom from responsibility, then
      that which was done, in consequence of your appeal,<a href="#fn631" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref631" role="doc-noteref"><sup>631</sup></a> by others, ought not to be
      ascribed to us.</p>
      <p>You set down your complaints in due order, saying that under
      Leontius and under Ursacius a very large number <a href="#fn632" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref632" role="doc-noteref"><sup>632</sup></a> suffered wrongfully, that
      some were put to death under Paulus and Macarius, that under their
      successors unnamed individuals were proscribed for a time. What
      has this to do with us, or with the Catholic Church? It is you who
      have brought about everything of which you complain, for you
      refused to accept gladly the peace which had been praised by God,
      valuing the inheritance of schism more highly than the precepts
      given us by the Saviour.</p>
      <p>You have brought accusations against the makers of unity. Blame
      unity itself, if you can! For I imagine that you do not deny that
      unity is the supreme good? <a href="#fn633" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref633" role="doc-noteref"><sup>633</sup></a></p>
      <p>How does the character of the workmen affect us, provided it be
      certain that they effected a work which is good? For the grape is
      trodden and pressed underfoot by sinful workmen, yet thence comes
      the wine with which Sacrifice is offered to God.<a href="#fn634" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref634" role="doc-noteref"><sup>634</sup></a> Oil, too, is made by

      is made for the severities exercised by the champions of

      <p>You say that the makers of unity did evil things.<a href="#fn639" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref639" role="doc-noteref"><sup>639</sup></a> Perhaps this was according
      to the Will of God, who is sometimes pleased to permit that which
      He might have prevented. For some evil things are done in an evil
      way <a href="#fn640" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref640" role="doc-noteref"><sup>640</sup></a>; some evil things are done
      in a good way.<a href="#fn641" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref641" role="doc-noteref"><sup>641</sup></a> The murderer <a href="#fn642" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref642" role="doc-noteref"><sup>642</sup></a> does an evil thing in an
      evil way, the judge does an evil thing in a good way when he
      punishes the murderer.<a href="#fn643" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref643" role="doc-noteref"><sup>643</sup></a></p>
      <p>For this is the Voice of God:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not kill’ <a href="#fn644" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref644" role="doc-noteref"><sup>644</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If any man shall be found sleeping with a woman who has a
      husband, you shall kill both,’ <a href="#fn645" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref645" role="doc-noteref"><sup>645</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>is also His Voice.</p>
      <p>One God, and two differing Voices. Thus when Phineas, the
      priest’s son, found an adulterer with an adulteress, he stood with
      raised sword in his hand and hesitated between the two divine
      Voices. One sounded in his ears:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not kill’ <a href="#fn646" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref646" role="doc-noteref"><sup>646</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>the other:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>You shall kill both.’ <a href="#fn647" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref647" role="doc-noteref"><sup>647</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Were he to strike, he would act contrary to law.<a href="#fn648" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref648" role="doc-noteref"><sup>648</sup></a> Were he not to strike, he
      would fail in his duty.<a href="#fn649" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref649" role="doc-noteref"><sup>649</sup></a> He chose the
      offence which was better <a href="#fn650" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref650" role="doc-noteref"><sup>650</sup></a> —to strike.
      And perhaps there were not wanting those who would have wished to
      brand him as a murderer for inflicting this punishment. But God,
      that He might show that some evil things are done in a good way,
      spoke thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Phineas has lessened <a href="#fn651" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref651" role="doc-noteref"><sup>651</sup></a> My wrath.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus God was pleased with the act of homicide, because thereby
      adultery was punished. What if God has now been pleased with those
      things which you say that you have suffered—you who refused to
      have unity, well pleasing to God, with the whole
      <span>[</span>Catholic<span>]</span> world, and with the ‘Shrines’
      of the Apostles? <a href="#fn652" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref652" role="doc-noteref"><sup>652</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="against-the-alleged-donatist-martyrs.">Against the alleged
      Donatist martyrs.</h3>
      <p>I am now compelled, against my will, to make mention of those
      men—whom I do not wish to mention—who are placed by you amongst
      the martyrs, by whom you swear, as the one thing which those of
      your communion hold sacred.<a href="#fn653" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref653" role="doc-noteref"><sup>653</sup></a> I should
      indeed prefer to pass them over in silence, but this is forbidden
      me by considerations of truth. On account of the names of these
      men, a mad hatred yelps thoughtlessly <a href="#fn654" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref654" role="doc-noteref"><sup>654</sup></a> against unity, and on
      account of them there are some who reject unity with contumely,
      thinking that it is something to be fled from or assailed, because
      Marculus and Donatus are said to have been slain and to be dead.
      As if no one at all ought ever to be killed in punishment of
      offences against God. No one ought to have been injured by the
      makers of unity, but neither ought the divine precepts to be
      despised by Bishops, to whom, the command was given:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Seek peace, and thou shalt obtain it’ <a href="#fn655" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref655" role="doc-noteref"><sup>655</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and once more:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together
      in unity.’ <a href="#fn656" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref656" role="doc-noteref"><sup>656</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And again:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the Sons
      of God.’ <a href="#fn657" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref657" role="doc-noteref"><sup>657</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Whatever evils those persons who refused to hear these words
      willingly, or loyally to carry them out, may have endured, they
      have themselves—if to be killed is an evil—brought their own evil
      upon themselves.<a href="#fn658" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref658" role="doc-noteref"><sup>658</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="macarius-is-defended-from-the-donatist-calumnies.">Macarius is
      defended from the Donatist calumnies.</h3>
      <p>But you contend that Macarius is to be blamed, because you
      think that his actions were not in accordance with the Will of
      God. Yet you will find men of old who were guilty of similar
      conduct. You should bring your charge first against Moses himself,
      the Lawgiver,<a href="#fn659" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref659" role="doc-noteref"><sup>659</sup></a> who, coming down from Mount
      Sinai, when the Tables of the Law on which it had been
      written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not kill,’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>had scarce been promulgated,<a href="#fn660" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref660" role="doc-noteref"><sup>660</sup></a> ordered three thousand men
      to be killed in one instant.<a href="#fn661" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref661" role="doc-noteref"><sup>661</sup></a></p>
      <p>Put Macarius aside for a little while. First appeal to <a href="#fn662" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref662" role="doc-noteref"><sup>662</sup></a> Phineas, the priest’s son,
      whom I mentioned just now,<a href="#fn663" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref663" role="doc-noteref"><sup>663</sup></a> to judge
      you—if indeed you know where to find any judge excepting God. For
      that which you blame has been praised by God in His own person,
      because it was done through zeal for God.<a href="#fn664" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref664" role="doc-noteref"><sup>664</sup></a> Meanwhile suppress for the
      moment <a href="#fn665" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref665" role="doc-noteref"><sup>665</sup></a> charges prompted by hatred
      against Macarius.</p>
      <p>First give your mind <a href="#fn666" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref666" role="doc-noteref"><sup>666</sup></a> to the Prophet
      Elias, who at the brook Cison,<a href="#fn667" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref667" role="doc-noteref"><sup>667</sup></a> in obedience to the Will of
      God, slew four hundred and fifty men. But perhaps you will answer
      that these were slain deservedly—your partisans <a href="#fn668" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref668" role="doc-noteref"><sup>668</sup></a> unjustly. Punishment never
      follows <a href="#fn669" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref669" role="doc-noteref"><sup>669</sup></a> without due cause. Moses
      inflicted punishment (as we have said), and Elias, and Phineas—but
      you will not have it that Macarius punished with justice.</p>
      <p>If those who are said to have been killed had in no way
      offended, it may be granted that Macarius was guilty in that which
      was done by him alone—a business of which we know nothing, but
      which was provoked by you.</p>
      <p>Why is prejudice created against us for things that were done
      by somebody else? Moreover, <em>you</em> are the cause of that
      which is said to have occurred, for it came about on your account,
      who were ‘outside’ <a href="#fn670" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref670" role="doc-noteref"><sup>670</sup></a> (even as you
      are still outside), not on account of us, who dwell ‘within,’ and
      have never departed from the root.<a href="#fn671" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref671" role="doc-noteref"><sup>671</sup></a></p>
      <p>But, since we have spoken concerning the above instances in
      order, let us now see why Moses commanded three thousand to be
      slain, why Phineas two, why Elias four hundred and fifty, why
      Macarius those two whose names you daily (as I have already said)
      fan with the fan of hatred.<a href="#fn672" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref672" role="doc-noteref"><sup>672</sup></a></p>
      <p>It is clear that those were punished who despised a divine
      command; for</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not make a graven image’ <a href="#fn673" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref673" role="doc-noteref"><sup>673</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>is the Voice of God, and</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’ <a href="#fn674" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref674" role="doc-noteref"><sup>674</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>is the Voice of the same God. The same God has said</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not offer sacrifice to idols’ <a href="#fn675" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref675" role="doc-noteref"><sup>675</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not make a schism.’ <a href="#fn676" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref676" role="doc-noteref"><sup>676</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Seek peace and thou shalt obtain it’ <a href="#fn677" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref677" role="doc-noteref"><sup>677</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>is the Commandment of the same God.</p>
      <p>In the days of Moses the people of Israel worshipped the head
      of a calf, which they had made in a sacrilegious fire <a href="#fn678" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref678" role="doc-noteref"><sup>678</sup></a>; on this account three
      thousand men deserved death, because they despised the Voice of
      God. Phineas at one blow slew the adulterers. He deserved to be
      praised by God, because he put to death those who despised His
      Commands. And the four hundred and fifty whom we read to have been
      slain by Elias, were slain for this reason, that, contrary to the
      Command of God—false prophets that they were—they had despised the
      divine Precepts. So also those two whose death you lay to the
      charge of Macarius are not far removed from false prophets. (For
      that God said you would be false prophets, we shall prove very
      soon.) And in refusing to look at Peace, lest they should dwell in
      unity with their brethren, they stood out obstinately against the
      Commands and against the Will of God.</p>
      <p>So you see that similar things were done by Moses and Phineas
      and Elias and Macarius, because the Commands of one God were
      vindicated by them all.</p>
      <p>But I see you now distinguishing between times, and saying that
      the times before the Gospel were different from those after the
      Gospel,<a href="#fn679" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref679" role="doc-noteref"><sup>679</sup></a> and you can bring forward
      the fact that it has been written that Peter put back into his
      sheath the sword with which he had cut off the ear of the high
      priest’s servant, whom, as though out of devotion,<a href="#fn680" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref680" role="doc-noteref"><sup>680</sup></a> he might have slain.</p>
      <p>But Christ had come to suffer, not to be defended. And if Peter
      had carried out his intention, it would have appeared that in the
      Passion of Christ, a servant was punished, not a people freed.</p>
      <h3 id="that-neither-can-macarius-be-called-a-persecutor-nor-can-those-who-were-put-to-death-by-him-be-call-martyrs.">That
      neither can Macarius be called a persecutor, nor can those who
      were put to death by him be call martyrs.</h3>
      <p>For that Macarius did not draw forth the sword which Peter
      sheathed, is proved by God, who, speaking to the valley of Sion,
      says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘They that have been wounded in thee were not wounded by the
      sword.’ <a href="#fn681" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref681" role="doc-noteref"><sup>681</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Show, if you can, that any one man in the time of Macarius was
      struck with the sword. He goes on to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘They that died in thee did not die in war.’ <a href="#fn682" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref682" role="doc-noteref"><sup>682</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So you should consider carefully whether it be not rash to call
      men, who experienced no war waged against Christians, by the name
      of martyrs.</p>
      <p>For nothing was at that time either done or heard, such as it
      has been customary to do or say in a war against Christians <a href="#fn683" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref683" role="doc-noteref"><sup>683</sup></a>—in a war that is called
      persecution, like that which was carried on under two of the four
      beasts which Daniel saw rising from the sea.<a href="#fn684" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref684" role="doc-noteref"><sup>684</sup></a></p>
      <p>Of these beasts, the first was like a lion. This was the
      persecution under Decius and Valerian. The second was like a bear.
      This was the second persecution under Diocletian and Maximian,
      when impious magistrates waged war against the Christian
      Name—amongst whom, sixty years and more ago, were Anulinus in the
      Proconsular Province, and Florus in Numidia.</p>
      <p>It is well known to all what their carefully planned cruelty <a href="#fn685" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref685" role="doc-noteref"><sup>685</sup></a> brought about. War, declared
      against the Christians, was raging furiously. In the temples of
      the demons the devil was triumphant. The altars were smoking with
      unclean odours,<a href="#fn686" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref686" role="doc-noteref"><sup>686</sup></a> and those who could not <a href="#fn687" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref687" role="doc-noteref"><sup>687</sup></a> come to the sacrilegious
      sacrifices were everywhere driven to offer incense.<a href="#fn688" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref688" role="doc-noteref"><sup>688</sup></a> Every spot was made into a
      temple of abomination.<a href="#fn689" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref689" role="doc-noteref"><sup>689</sup></a> Old men, soon
      to be on their deathbeds, were defiled <a href="#fn690" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref690" role="doc-noteref"><sup>690</sup></a>; unwitting infancy was
      polluted; little children were carried by their mothers to the
      shameful deed; parents were driven to the bloodless slaughter of
      their children <a href="#fn691" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref691" role="doc-noteref"><sup>691</sup></a>; some were driven to destroy
      the temples of the living God, others to deny Christ, others to
      burn the books of God,<a href="#fn692" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref692" role="doc-noteref"><sup>692</sup></a> others to
      offer incense.</p>
      <p>Not even you will be able to pretend that any of these things
      was done by Macarius. Under the persecutor Florus, Christians were
      forced to the temples of idols; under Macarius, the slothful <a href="#fn693" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref693" role="doc-noteref"><sup>693</sup></a> were ordered <a href="#fn694" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref694" role="doc-noteref"><sup>694</sup></a> to the
      <span>[</span>Christian<span>]</span> basilica. Under Florus, the
      command was given to deny Christ and pray to idols. Under
      Macarius, on the contrary, all were warned that one God should be
      prayed to by all together in the Church.<a href="#fn695" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref695" role="doc-noteref"><sup>695</sup></a></p>
      <p>Since then you see that no war was waged against Christians;
      and that God mentions that some have died without war, saying ‘And
      they who died in thee did not die in war’ <a href="#fn696" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref696" role="doc-noteref"><sup>696</sup></a>; and that those may well be
      held to be but doubtful martyrs who were not urged either to
      sacrilegious sacrifices, or to profane offering of incense,<a href="#fn697" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref697" role="doc-noteref"><sup>697</sup></a> or to denial of the Name of
      God; and that there is no path to martyrdom excepting through
      confession—with what reason can you call those men martyrs, who
      were not confessors? Or, which among them was driven <a href="#fn698" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref698" role="doc-noteref"><sup>698</sup></a> to deny Christ, and
      confessed His Name?</p>
      <p>So, if there can be no martyrdom apart from confession of the
      Name of Christ—and if in this case no one confessed Christ—and if
      that which you assert to have been done, was done in vindication
      of the Commands of God—and if, whereas God had prophesied that
      this should come to pass, His Commands were vindicated, whilst you
      are unable to prove that we had any share in it—if these things be
      so, consider whether it be not merely idle, but also
      superstitious, to place those who died without persecution <a href="#fn699" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref699" role="doc-noteref"><sup>699</sup></a> where <em>they</em> are,
      who, having confessed Christ, were allowed to die on behalf of the
      Name of God.</p>
      <p>Or, if you will have it that they are martyrs—prove that they
      were lovers of Peace (in which are laid the first foundations of
      martyrdom), or that unity, beloved by God, was dear to them, or
      that they lived in charity with their brethren—(for that all
      Christians are brothers we have proved in our first Book, and
      shall also prove beyond doubt in our fourth).</p>
      <p>Those men who (as you maintain) ought to be called martyrs,
      refused to recognise their brethren, and had no charity.</p>
      <p>And let it not be said in their excuse that they were unwilling
      to hold communion with Betrayers, since it has been most clearly
      proved that they themselves were the sons of Betrayers. Therefore
      you have no way of excusing them, for it is abundantly clear that
      they had not charity, without which martyrdom can neither be
      <span>[</span>rightly<span>]</span> named nor have any existence,
      without which the very greatest and most commanding <a href="#fn700" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref700" role="doc-noteref"><sup>700</sup></a> virtue loses its effect,
      without which the knowledge of all tongues is worthless, without
      which even the fellowship of angels is of no avail—as says the
      Apostle Paul:</p>
      <p>‘If I have the power of commanding mountains so as to move them
      from place to place, and if I speak with the tongues of all
      nations, even of angels, and if I deliver my body to the flames,
      and have not charity in me, I am nothing. But I shall be as
      tinkling brass <a href="#fn701" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref701" role="doc-noteref"><sup>701</sup></a> in the desert, so that the
      effect of my word should die away there, where there is none to
      hear.’ <a href="#fn702" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref702" role="doc-noteref"><sup>702</sup></a></p>
      <p>If one so great,<a href="#fn703" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref703" role="doc-noteref"><sup>703</sup></a> if the blessed
      Paul, if the Vessel of Election, declares that (although
      possessing commanding virtue <a href="#fn704" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref704" role="doc-noteref"><sup>704</sup></a> and the
      company of angels) he is nothing, unless he have charity, consider
      whether they ought not to be called something very different from
      martyrs, who, having deserted charity, may, by reason of that
      desertion, perhaps have suffered something.</p>
      <h3 id="it-was-necessary-to-bring-about-unity-in-africa.">It was
      necessary to bring about unity in Africa.</h3>
      <p>The whole world rejoices concerning Catholic unity, excepting a
      portion of Africa, in which a conflagration has been blown up from
      a spark. You complain that some evil deeds or other <a href="#fn705" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref705" role="doc-noteref"><sup>705</sup></a> were committed by the makers
      of unity. No complaint of this kind is made by Italy, or by Gaul,
      or by Spain, or by Pannonia, or by Galatia, or by Greece, or by
      any of the Provinces of Asia.</p>
      <p>No one was sent there to put things right,<a href="#fn706" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref706" role="doc-noteref"><sup>706</sup></a> because there was nothing

      <p>Here, too, in Africa, of old—so long as the people remained in

      hand of an enemy. It may be said, metaphorically, that pieces,

      <p>How will it be if the severities (great though they may have

      <p>Call to mind how of old you tore away one from another the
      members of Mother Church.<a href="#fn735" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref735" role="doc-noteref"><sup>735</sup></a> For you were
      not able to seduce any one family at once. Either the wife
      departed and the husband stayed behind, or the parents were
      seduced and the children refused to follow them, or the brother
      stood firm, when his sister wandered off. At your instigation
      divisions were made between man and wife—between parents and their
      children—and you could not even leave in peace that which natural
      law permits.<a href="#fn736" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref736" role="doc-noteref"><sup>736</sup></a></p>
      <p>No doubt, you have said:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>but God on the other hand asks:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Peace, and where is peace?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>that is to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Why do you give a salutation concerning that which you have
      not? Why do you name that which you have destroyed? Peace you love
      not, yet do you give a salutation concerning peace.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>‘They,’ He says, ‘built a wall which is ready to fall.’ <a href="#fn737" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref737" role="doc-noteref"><sup>737</sup></a></p>
      <p>The House of God is one.<a href="#fn738" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref738" role="doc-noteref"><sup>738</sup></a></p>
      <p>They who have gone out and wished to make a party,<a href="#fn739" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref739" role="doc-noteref"><sup>739</sup></a> have built a wall, not a
      house, for there is no second God, to dwell in a second house.<a href="#fn740" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref740" role="doc-noteref"><sup>740</sup></a></p>
      <p>On this account false prophets are said to have made a wall,
      and if a door be placed <a href="#fn741" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref741" role="doc-noteref"><sup>741</sup></a> in this wall,
      anyone who enters through that door is
      <span>[</span>still<span>]</span> outside.<a href="#fn742" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref742" role="doc-noteref"><sup>742</sup></a> Nor can a single wall have
      the Corner Stone—the Stone which is Christ, who, receiving into
      Himself two peoples—Gentiles and Jews—joins both walls with the
      bond of peace.<a href="#fn743" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref743" role="doc-noteref"><sup>743</sup></a></p>
      <p>For a wall has as many disadvantages as a house has advantages.
      The house protects all that is shut within it, turns the edge <a href="#fn744" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref744" role="doc-noteref"><sup>744</sup></a> of the storm, throws off <a href="#fn745" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref745" role="doc-noteref"><sup>745</sup></a> the rain, keeps out murderer
      <a href="#fn746" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref746" role="doc-noteref"><sup>746</sup></a> and thief <a href="#fn747" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref747" role="doc-noteref"><sup>747</sup></a> and beast. Thus also the
      Catholic Church embraces all the sons of peace in her bosom and
      breast. On the other hand the wall, which has been built in a
      ruinous state,<a href="#fn748" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref748" role="doc-noteref"><sup>748</sup></a> supports no corner stone <a href="#fn749" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref749" role="doc-noteref"><sup>749</sup></a>; it has a purposeless door
      <a href="#fn750" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref750" role="doc-noteref"><sup>750</sup></a>; it keeps nothing inside it
      <a href="#fn751" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref751" role="doc-noteref"><sup>751</sup></a>; but is soaked with the
      rain,<a href="#fn752" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref752" role="doc-noteref"><sup>752</sup></a> is struck by the storm, and
      is able neither to keep off the murderer, nor to stop the thief
      when he approaches.</p>
      <p>The wall belongs to the house, but is not the house.</p>
      <p>So your party is a quasi-church, but is not the Catholic
      Church.<a href="#fn753" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref753" role="doc-noteref"><sup>753</sup></a></p>
      <p>‘And,’ He says, ‘they whiten it.’ That is to say that you judge
      yourselves alone to be saints. You complain that you have had some
      sufferings (though we had nothing to do with them). Therefore it
      is certain that these were sufferings which you endured alone, for
      the time of peace is different from the time of persecution.</p>
      <p>If you consider that it was a persecution, tell us, what had
      all the Provinces, of which the Catholic Church is composed,<a href="#fn754" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref754" role="doc-noteref"><sup>754</sup></a> to suffer together with
      you?</p>
      <p>Since it was ‘punishment,’ not persecution, the wall suffered
      alone, against which God threatened storm, rain, thunderbolts and
      accusations, for thus did He speak:</p>
      <p>‘Why have you built up a ruin? Why have you made it white? Why
      have you painted <a href="#fn755" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref755" role="doc-noteref"><sup>755</sup></a> it? This is
      against My Will, saith the Lord.’ <a href="#fn756" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref756" role="doc-noteref"><sup>756</sup></a></p>
      <p>You are displeased with the days of a Leontius, of an Ursacius,
      of a Macarius and the rest. Put right <a href="#fn757" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref757" role="doc-noteref"><sup>757</sup></a> the Will of God, if you can,
      who has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I will rise against the wall in My wrath, and will send upon
      it much storm and rain, floods and thunderbolts,<a href="#fn758" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref758" role="doc-noteref"><sup>758</sup></a> and I will strike the wall
      that is ready to fall, and its joints shall be loosened.’ <a href="#fn759" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref759" role="doc-noteref"><sup>759</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And do not let any of your party object with the question:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If unity is a good thing, how is it that, after having been so
      often brought about, it has not been able to last?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For this reason, that the matter has been arranged thus by God,
      who threatened storm, rain, stones and accusations.<a href="#fn760" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref760" role="doc-noteref"><sup>760</sup></a> Now these four things could
      not happen at the same time. First there was a <em>storm</em>
      under Ursacius.<a href="#fn761" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref761" role="doc-noteref"><sup>761</sup></a> The wall <a href="#fn762" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref762" role="doc-noteref"><sup>762</sup></a> was then shaken, but did not
      fall, so that <em>rain</em> might have an opportunity to work.<a href="#fn763" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref763" role="doc-noteref"><sup>763</sup></a> <em>Rain</em> then followed
      under Gregory.<a href="#fn764" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref764" role="doc-noteref"><sup>764</sup></a> The wall was made wet, but
      was not swamped,<a href="#fn765" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref765" role="doc-noteref"><sup>765</sup></a> so that the
      stones might have their opportunity. Under the makers of unity the
      <em>stones</em> followed after the rain. The wall was scattered
      about,<a href="#fn766" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref766" role="doc-noteref"><sup>766</sup></a> but built itself up again
      from its foundations. Three things have already been accomplished.
      Accusations are still due to you, but how they are to come and
      when, is known to Him, who has been pleased to make these
      declarations concerning you.</p>
      <h3 id="it-is-shown-that-the-donatists-are-deceivers.">It is shown
      that the Donatists are deceivers.</h3>
      <p>And that no one might doubt as to the meaning of this, God has
      added these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The things which I speak concern not the clay <a href="#fn767" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref767" role="doc-noteref"><sup>767</sup></a> or the side <a href="#fn768" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref768" role="doc-noteref"><sup>768</sup></a> <span>[</span>of the

      but false prophets who deceive <a href="#fn769" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref769" role="doc-noteref"><sup>769</sup></a> My people.’ <a href="#fn770" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref770" role="doc-noteref"><sup>770</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Consider whom this word ‘deceive’ fits. All were in communion
      with us. You rushed in upon us in our absence,<a href="#fn771" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref771" role="doc-noteref"><sup>771</sup></a> but, in order to possess
      those whom you coveted, you had to beguile them—and all men know
      what are your words of beguilement.</p>
      <p>You are wont to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Look behind you.’ <a href="#fn772" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref772" role="doc-noteref"><sup>772</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You are wont to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Redeem your souls.’ <a href="#fn773" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref773" role="doc-noteref"><sup>773</sup></a> * *</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You are wont to say to Christian men—even to clerics:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Be ye Christians.’ <a href="#fn774" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref774" role="doc-noteref"><sup>774</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But in saying ‘Look behind you,’ you are acting against the
      gospel, in which it has been written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘No man who holds the handle of the plough and looks behind him
      shall enter the kingdom of heaven.’ <a href="#fn775" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref775" role="doc-noteref"><sup>775</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And do you wish to know what was the fate of the one who looked
      behind, and of the one who looked before? Remember those who
      escaped from Sodom —Lot and his wife. She looked behind her and
      was changed into a pillar of salt, whilst he who looked before him
      escaped free.<a href="#fn776" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref776" role="doc-noteref"><sup>776</sup></a> Why then do you say ‘Look
      behind you’? Moreover, when you say ‘Redeem your souls,’ I would
      ask from whom did you buy them, that you should sell them? Who is
      that angel who deals in souls as in the market-place? <a href="#fn777" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref777" role="doc-noteref"><sup>777</sup></a> When you say ‘Redeem your
      souls’ you are renouncing the Redeemer, for Christ alone is the
      Redeemer of souls, which before His coming were possessed by the
      Devil. These Christ our Saviour redeemed in His Blood, as the
      Apostle says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You have been bought at a great price.’ <a href="#fn778" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref778" role="doc-noteref"><sup>778</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For it is certain that we have been all redeemed by the Blood
      of Christ. Christ has not sold those whom He redeemed. Souls
      bought by Christ cannot be sold, to be redeemed again—as you would
      have it <a href="#fn779" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref779" role="doc-noteref"><sup>779</sup></a>—by you.</p>
      <p>Again, how can a soul have two Lords? Or, is there, perhaps, a
      second Redeemer? What prophets have announced that a second is to
      come? What Gabriel has spoken a second time to a second Mary? What
      Virgin has a second time given birth to a Child? Who has worked
      new or second deeds of power? <a href="#fn780" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref780" role="doc-noteref"><sup>780</sup></a></p>
      <p>If there is none, save One, who has redeemed the souls of all
      believers, what means it that you say ‘Redeem your souls’? What
      kind of thing is this that you say to Christian men—even to
      clerics—‘Be ye Christians’? And you dare to say to each one, as
      though you expected a miracle <a href="#fn781" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref781" role="doc-noteref"><sup>781</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Gaius Seius, or Gaia Seia,<a href="#fn782" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref782" role="doc-noteref"><sup>782</sup></a> art thou still a pagan man

      <p>You call him, who has acknowledged <a href="#fn783" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref783" role="doc-noteref"><sup>783</sup></a> that he has been converted
      to God, a pagan—him you call a pagan, who has been washed by us or

      Christ (for some there are who have been baptised by you, and have
      afterwards passed over to our Communion)—him you call a pagan, who
      before the altar <a href="#fn784" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref784" role="doc-noteref"><sup>784</sup></a> has prayed to
      God the Father through His Son. For whoever has believed, has
      believed in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy

      <p>If—which God forbid—any Christian should fall away,<a href="#fn785" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref785" role="doc-noteref"><sup>785</sup></a> he may be called a sinner; a

      <p>But all these things you wish to be held of no account. And if
      he, whom you deceive, listens to you,<a href="#fn787" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref787" role="doc-noteref"><sup>787</sup></a> then his consent alone, and
      the stretching forth of your hand,<a href="#fn788" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref788" role="doc-noteref"><sup>788</sup></a> and a few words spoken by

      array,<a href="#fn798" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref798" role="doc-noteref"><sup>798</sup></a> they would bring out an
      image,<a href="#fn799" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref799" role="doc-noteref"><sup>799</sup></a> which they would first place
      upon the altar, and that then in this way was the sacrifice to be
      offered.</p>
      <p>As soon as their ears heard this, not only were their minds
      disquieted, but everyone’s tongue was stirred up to use these
      words, so that all who had heard the story cried out:</p>
      <p>‘He who partakes of this, partakes of a sacrilege.’ <a href="#fn800" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref800" role="doc-noteref"><sup>800</sup></a> And rightly would this have
      been said, if any corresponding truth had attached to such a
      tale.</p>
      <p>But when the above-mentioned officers arrived, nothing was seen
      of that, concerning which a little before lying reports had been
      spread. Christian eyes saw nothing to shock them, their sight
      afforded no proof of those things which had upset their
      hearing.</p>
      <p>No stain was beheld, and the solemn rite was observed after the
      accustomed manner.<a href="#fn801" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref801" role="doc-noteref"><sup>801</sup></a> When they saw
      that in the divine sacrifices <a href="#fn802" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref802" role="doc-noteref"><sup>802</sup></a> nothing was changed, or
      added or taken away, the Peace which God has praised was pleasing
      to men of good will.<a href="#fn803" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref803" role="doc-noteref"><sup>803</sup></a></p>
      <p>On this account none of those ought to be blamed who from your
      body has made his way to Peace.<a href="#fn804" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref804" role="doc-noteref"><sup>804</sup></a> They who had been disturbed

      that of the sweet he has made the bitter.</p>
      <p>The bitterness, which was proclaimed by falsehood, remained and
      continued in the breast of <span>[</span>mere<span>]</span>
      opinion; the truth which was seen with the eyes, having its own
      sweetness in itself,<a href="#fn805" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref805" role="doc-noteref"><sup>805</sup></a> was separated
      from the boundaries of a false opinion. So neither was that which
      is sweet made out of bitterness, nor was that which is bitter made
      out of sweetness. For what was seen was something else and quite
      different,<a href="#fn806" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref806" role="doc-noteref"><sup>806</sup></a> and the report had been very

      <h3 id="in-what-way-and-why-macarius-was-admitted-to-communion.">In
      what way and why Macarius was admitted to Communion.</h3>
      <p>Now your malice has come to such a pitch that you say that
      Macarius after these events ought not to have been admitted to
      Communion, but rather should have been repelled by Catholic
      Bishops. In the first place, communion has only one name, but
      various modes. A Bishop is in communion with a Bishop in one way
      and a layman is in communion with a Bishop in another way.</p>
      <p>Secondly, it would be a grave matter if Macarius had done that
      which he is said to have done, of his own will, since those who
      act thus are punished by the public courts and the Roman laws. For
      that man is a murderer who, compelled by no necessity, by no one’s
      commands, by no superior authority, but, driven on by rage, of his
      own will, does what the laws forbid. But it was in consequence of
      your appeal <a href="#fn810" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref810" role="doc-noteref"><sup>810</sup></a> that Macarius did what he is
      said to have done.</p>
      <p>He was not a Bishop, and did not discharge the duties of a
      Bishop. Neither did he lay hands on anyone, nor did he offer
      sacrifice. Wherefore, as it is clear that he had nothing to do
      with the functions of Bishops, no Bishop was polluted by reason of
      one who did not offer sacrifice with Bishops. Nothing remains for
      you but to urge that he communicated with the people, and, indeed,
      it is certain that he spoke amongst the people, but only to press
      some point, not to preach—which belongs to Bishops.<a href="#fn811" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref811" role="doc-noteref"><sup>811</sup></a> For he spoke, if he was able
      to speak at all, stripped of any authority. On the other hand, a
      Bishop’s discourse is approved by all, being adorned with
      sanctity, that is to say, with a twofold salutation. For a Bishop
      does not commence to say anything to the people without first
      saluting the people in the name of God. As he begins, so does he
      end. Every sermon in the church is begun by the name of God and
      with the name of God is also ended. Which of you will dare to say
      that Macarius saluted the people after the manner of Bishops?
      Therefore, since he neither saluted before he spoke, nor ventured
      to salute after having spoken, nor laid his hand on anyone, nor
      offered sacrifice to God with episcopal rite, how can you say that
      the College of Bishops can have been polluted, although you see
      that Macarius had nothing to do with any episcopal duty?</p>
      <p>Your malice, having been in this point trodden under foot by
      the footprints of truth, is seen again to raise its head. For you
      say that he ought not even to have communicated amongst laymen.
      Yet it is certain that he was (as the Apostle Paul shows) a
      minister of the Will of God, and what wonder, if even the pagan
      judges should be considered ministers of the Will of God,
      according to the Apostle who says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The judge does not bear the sword without reason,<a href="#fn812" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref812" role="doc-noteref"><sup>812</sup></a> for he is a minister of the
      Will of God.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, too, Macarius was a judge in his own person. And if he did
      not act judicially, he ought, by the laws of Rome, to have been
      punished by the judges. Or, if you say that even so Macarius
      should not have been admitted to communion, still we do not see
      that he ought to have been repelled, who acted in the same kind of
      manner as did Moses, whom God did not reject after twenty-three
      thousand men had been killed, but called him to speak with Him a
      second time.<a href="#fn813" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref813" role="doc-noteref"><sup>813</sup></a> We do not see that he ought
      to have been repelled, who did the same thing as did Phineas (whom
      I have mentioned above), and then deserved to receive Divine
      praise.<a href="#fn814" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref814" role="doc-noteref"><sup>814</sup></a> It does not seem to us that
      he ought to have been repelled, who did that which was done by
      Elias the prophet, when he slew so many false prophets.<a href="#fn815" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref815" role="doc-noteref"><sup>815</sup></a> (For that they too were
      false teachers we have proved above.)</p>
      <h3 id="that-even-if-macarius-was-guilty-he-ought-not-to-have-been-repelled-from-communion.">That
      even if Macarius was guilty, he ought not to have been repelled
      from Communion.</h3>
      <p>But were we to keep silence concerning these examples and admit
      with you that Macarius was guilty—even so, he ought not to have
      been repelled by us in the absence of an accuser. For it has been
      written that no man should be condemned before his case has been
      heard.</p>
      <p>Tell us, then, who accused him and was not listened to? Tell us
      (if you can) that Macarius confessed his fault and that we did not
      pronounce sentence. For after all, we are in the Church judges of
      a kind,<a href="#fn816" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref816" role="doc-noteref"><sup>816</sup></a> as you yourselves do not
      deny. Indeed, you maintain that we ought to judge in accordance
      with truth. We, then, cannot do that which God has not done. In
      His Judgement He has thought well to separate persons, and has not
      willed that one man should be at the same time accuser and judge.
      For no man can in one case at the same moment bear the weight of
      two persons,<a href="#fn817" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref817" role="doc-noteref"><sup>817</sup></a> so as to be in the same
      judgement both accuser and judge. This is a thing which God has
      not done by His omnipotence, but, in order to set before us the
      form of passing judgement, has taught us that neither should a
      guilty man be condemned without an accuser, nor should he be the
      accuser, who would be the judge in the same case.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, at the very beginning of the world, when men were
      commencing to be born, after his brother Abel had been killed by
      Cain, we read that God called Cain and asked him where was his
      brother.<a href="#fn818" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref818" role="doc-noteref"><sup>818</sup></a> He doubled his sin and said
      that he did not know, as though he would make God ignorant, and
      when could there be anything not known to God, under whose eyes
      and countenance are all things which are done? Nevertheless, God
      does not judge without an accuser and asks concerning a thing
      which surely He knew. And yet you wish us to repel one whom we
      have not seen doing any evil, and who has had no one to accuse
      him. I perceive here what your malice is about to whisper: you
      will say that what has been done has not escaped our knowledge. We
      acknowledge that we have heard about it, but to condemn one whom
      no man has ventured to accuse would be to sin. If you tell us that
      his deed has not escaped us, will you tell God, who had seen the
      brother’s murder, why He asked about it? It would not have been
      right for us to do something which God refused to do, when He
      would not pass sentence, excepting on one who was guilty. You must
      find an accuser. Otherwise the condemnation could not be
      just—unless he who should pass sentence was himself to be the
      accuser! Wherefore God says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold thy brother’s blood. It cries to me from the earth.’ <a href="#fn819" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref819" role="doc-noteref"><sup>819</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus it is that, since by no means can you prove that Macarius
      was accused before us by any man, you cannot find fault with our
      judgement.</p>

      <p>If, that is, you are freely content to hear this ascription of
      brotherhood which I have so often used. And I would beg of you to
      recognise that, however distasteful the word <em>brother</em> may
      be to you, still it has of necessity to be employed by us, lest
      perchance (considering the proof that it ought to be used) we
      should, by refraining from it, be blameworthy. For, if you are not
      willing to be my brother, I should begin to be unbrotherly,<a href="#fn827" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref827" role="doc-noteref"><sup>827</sup></a> were I to keep silence
      concerning this name. For you are our brethren, and we are yours,
      as the Prophet says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Has not one God made you, and one Father begotten you?’ <a href="#fn828" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref828" role="doc-noteref"><sup>828</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nor can you avoid being our brethren, since to all has it been
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You are all gods and sons of the Most High.’ <a href="#fn829" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref829" role="doc-noteref"><sup>829</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And both you and we have received the one command in the

      <p>‘Call no man your father on earth, because One is your Father
      in the Heavens.’ <a href="#fn830" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref830" role="doc-noteref"><sup>830</sup></a></p>

      <p>Our Saviour Christ alone is the Son of God by Birth,<a href="#fn831" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref831" role="doc-noteref"><sup>831</sup></a> but both you and we have

      <blockquote>

      <p>But you will not have peace with us, that is, with your

      <p>Wherefore Christ, foreseeing this time—how it would come to
      pass that you should to-day be at variance with us, gave such
      commands with regard to prayer, that, at least in prayer,<a href="#fn838" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref838" role="doc-noteref"><sup>838</sup></a> unity might remain, and that
      supplications might join those who should be torn asunder by

      us, even though you do not wish it. Otherwise let any one of you
      say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘<em>My</em> Father, who art in Heaven,’ and ‘Give <em>me
      my</em> daily bread,’ and ‘Forgive <em>me my</em> trespasses, as
      <em>I</em> forgive <em>him</em> who trespasses against
      <em>me.</em>’</p>

      <p>Accordingly, if things which have been prescribed may not be
      changed, you see that we have not been absolutely <a href="#fn839" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref839" role="doc-noteref"><sup>839</sup></a> divided from one another,
      whilst we willingly pray for you, and you (though unwillingly)

      <h3 id="that-the-donatists-are-sinners.">That the Donatists are

      <p>Let human mistrust give way, and the arguments of both sides

      said:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>Here we have to give the whole attention of our mind, and see
      who is the sinner.</p>
      <p>For, if after we have read:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“ ‘But to the sinner God said,’</p>

      <p>then <em>the soldier</em> would have reason to fear, because he

      <p>then <em>the sailor</em> would have to fear, because he might

      <p>these words were to follow:</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>if these things were to be read immediately afterwards, then
      <em>we</em> should have to fear that we were the sinners.</p>
      <p>But when God says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Why dost thou declare My commandments and take My covenant in

      <p>‘Seek peace, and thou shalt obtain it.’ <a href="#fn848" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref848" role="doc-noteref"><sup>848</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thou hast rejected peace. Is not this to despise
      discipline?</p>
      <p>In the Gospel we read:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘On earth peace to men of good will.’ <a href="#fn849" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref849" role="doc-noteref"><sup>849</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thou wilt have neither peace nor good will. Is not this to
      despise discipline?</p>
      <p>Moreover, we read in the hundred and thirty-second Psalm:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold how good and pleasant it is to dwell together in
      unity.’ <a href="#fn850" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref850" role="doc-noteref"><sup>850</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thou <a href="#fn851" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref851" role="doc-noteref"><sup>851</sup></a> wilt not dwell in unity with
      thy brethren. Is not this to despise discipline?</p>
      <p>Christ says in the Gospel:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He who has once been cleansed, has no need to be cleansed
      anew.’ <a href="#fn852" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref852" role="doc-noteref"><sup>852</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thou by rebaptising dost cleanse anew. Is not this to despise
      discipline? God says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Touch not Mine anointed, and lay not thy hand upon My
      Prophets.’ <a href="#fn853" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref853" role="doc-noteref"><sup>853</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You <a href="#fn854" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref854" role="doc-noteref"><sup>854</sup></a> have stripped so many
      priests of God of their dignities. Is not this to despise
      discipline?</p>
      <p>Christ says:</p>
      <blockquote>

      another.’ <a href="#fn855" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref855" role="doc-noteref"><sup>855</sup></a></p>

      <p>You hold in hatred us, who are surely your brethren; nor have
      you been willing to imitate the Apostles, by whom Peter was
      beloved, though he denied his Lord.<a href="#fn856" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref856" role="doc-noteref"><sup>856</sup></a> Is not this to despise

      <p>When God reproves the sinner and chides him that <em>sits,</em>

      </blockquote>
      <p>I have so many times proved that we have one mother, nor can
      you deny this—you who ‘lay scandals against’ us—though some of
      your party allege texts which they have not understood, in order
      to take away from us even what is usually shared by all men—the
      courtesy of salutation. For some of you refuse us the embraces
      that are customary in everyday life,<a href="#fn870" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref870" role="doc-noteref"><sup>870</sup></a> and many are taught not to
      say ‘God speed you’ <a href="#fn871" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref871" role="doc-noteref"><sup>871</sup></a> to any one of
      us, and think that this is commanded by what they have read
      without understanding it, through not knowing of whom it was that
      an Apostle <a href="#fn872" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref872" role="doc-noteref"><sup>872</sup></a> has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘With such as these not even to take food,’ nor ‘say “God speed

      sore.’ <a href="#fn873" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref873" role="doc-noteref"><sup>873</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This was said of heretics, whose teaching at that time began to
      be full of errors, for through the subtle seductiveness of their
      speech, they introduced diseases, creeping along in the darkness,
      to corrupt the soundness of the Faith.<a href="#fn874" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref874" role="doc-noteref"><sup>874</sup></a> Such a one was Marcion, who
      from a Bishop became an Apostate, and. brought in two Gods and two
      Christs; such was Ebion,<a href="#fn875" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref875" role="doc-noteref"><sup>875</sup></a> who argued
      that not the Son but the Father had suffered; such Valentinus, who
      strove to take away from Christ His Flesh.</p>
      <p>This is that speech which had a cancer <a href="#fn876" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref876" role="doc-noteref"><sup>876</sup></a> to torment the members of
      the Faith. This has been said also of the heretic Scorpian,<a href="#fn877" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref877" role="doc-noteref"><sup>877</sup></a> who maintained that there
      ought to be no martyrdom.</p>
      <p>But let them keep their poisons for themselves, and let no
      discourse <a href="#fn878" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref878" role="doc-noteref"><sup>878</sup></a> with them be allowed, lest
      by listening to them simple minds be troubled, however
      slightly.</p>
      <p>Wherefore these are they whose speech has to be avoided, lest
      it creep in, like a spreading sore.</p>
      <p>This was said too of Arius, who endeavoured to teach that the
      Son of God was made out of non-existing substances,<a href="#fn879" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref879" role="doc-noteref"><sup>879</sup></a> and not born of God—whose
      teaching, had it not been driven away by three hundred and
      eighteen Bishops in the Nicene Council, would, like a cancer, have
      entered the breasts of many.</p>
      <p>This was said also of Photinus, a heretic of the present time,
      who has dared to say that the Son of God was merely a man, not
      God.</p>
      <p>It may have been said of you as well, since your word has
      introduced no small cancer into the ears and minds of some. This
      is your word, which you address to the sons of Peace, when you
      say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You have perished. Look behind you. Your soul will be lost.
      How long do you hang back? <a href="#fn880" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref880" role="doc-noteref"><sup>880</sup></a>’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In this way have you made Penitents of the Faithful; thus have
      you destroyed the honours due to Priests.<a href="#fn881" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref881" role="doc-noteref"><sup>881</sup></a> Behold! It is your word
      also, which to-day creeps on as a spreading sore, so that you
      forbid us the greetings and ordinary intercourse of life.</p>
      <p>But how could our teaching have produced any such result? We
      guard the sons of Peace with pure <a href="#fn882" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref882" role="doc-noteref"><sup>882</sup></a> teaching; we lead no
      strangers astray; we ruin no man. It is therefore clear that you
      daily ‘lay scandals against’ us, and it would be a long matter to
      go through all the ways in which you slander us, and all the kinds
      of scandal which you ‘lay against’ us.</p>
      <h3 id="that-the-donatists-are-thieves-and-on-what-ground.">That
      the Donatists are thieves and on what ground.</h3>
      <p>For also when God says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou didst see a thief and didst run with him,’ <a href="#fn883" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref883" role="doc-noteref"><sup>883</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>concerning what kind of thievery think you that this has been
      said? Was it perhaps on account of some stolen article of
      clothing, or some pocket that had been picked,<a href="#fn884" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref884" role="doc-noteref"><sup>884</sup></a> or about goods the stealing
      of which brings loss and gain to men?</p>
      <p>Yes, without doubt such thefts as these are forbidden; but in
      this passage God rebukes those which are made from Himself. Do you
      ask what thefts are made from God? They are to be found amongst
      you! God’s possession is the mass of the Faithful,<a href="#fn885" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref885" role="doc-noteref"><sup>885</sup></a> from which that thief the
      Devil tries every day to steal something, striving to corrupt in
      some way or other the morals of a Christian man or woman, and thus
      to snatch away, if not the whole man—at any rate something or
      other from the man.</p>
      <p>Since you saw this Thief bringing force to bear against us, you
      have helped him by your deeds. For none are unaware, that everyone
      who is born (even though he may be born of Christian parents)
      cannot be without the unclean spirit, who must of necessity be
      driven out and separated from a man before the saving layer. This
      is effected by the exorcism,<a href="#fn886" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref886" role="doc-noteref"><sup>886</sup></a> through which
      the unclean spirit is cast forth and driven, in flight, to desert
      places.</p>
      <p>The house in the heart of the Believer is made empty, the house
      is made clean. God enters and dwells therein, even as says the
      Apostle:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘You are the Temple of God, and God dwells in you.’ <a href="#fn887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref887" role="doc-noteref"><sup>887</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Whereas then each <span>[</span>baptised<span>]</span> man is
      full of God, and that Thief the Devil is endeavouring to steal
      something away from him, you exorcise that faithful man by
      rebaptising him, and say to God, who dwells within him:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Go forth, O cursed one,’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>that there may be fulfilled what was spoken by Ezekiel the
      Prophet:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘And they spoke evil things to Me amongst My people for the
      sake of a handful of barley and a morsel of bread, that they might
      kill souls which ought not to die, whilst they announce to My
      people empty deceits.’ <a href="#fn888" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref888" role="doc-noteref"><sup>888</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So God hears wrongful insults, which are not His due, and
      departs from such a dwelling as this; and the man who, when he
      entered the church, was full of God, goes out an empty vessel.</p>
      <p>The Devil, who wished, like a thief, to steal something, sees
      that the whole, from which he was striving to snatch some little
      thing, has become his by your assistance. Wherefore, of you God
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou didst see a thief and didst run together with him.’ <a href="#fn889" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref889" role="doc-noteref"><sup>889</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Again it has been written in the Gospel:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘But when God shall have left a man, he remains an empty
      vessel, but the unclean spirit wandering through desert places,
      says, in his hunger <a href="#fn890" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref890" role="doc-noteref"><sup>890</sup></a>: ’’ My house
      is empty,” <a href="#fn891" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref891" role="doc-noteref"><sup>891</sup></a> that is to say, He who had
      shut me out has been Himself shut out. ” I will go back and dwell
      therein.” And he brings with him seven others more wicked, and he
      shall dwell there, and that man’s last state shall be worse than
      his first.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That is:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou didst see a thief and didst run together with him, and
      with adulterers didst cast thy lot.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He terms heretics adulterers, and their churches adulterous,<a href="#fn892" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref892" role="doc-noteref"><sup>892</sup></a> which Christ contemns and
      disowns <a href="#fn893" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref893" role="doc-noteref"><sup>893</sup></a> in the Canticle of
      Canticles, as though He should say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Why do you make churches that “are not wanted <a href="#fn894" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref894" role="doc-noteref"><sup>894</sup></a>”?’</p>
      <p>‘One is My beloved, one is My Spouse, one is My dove’ <a href="#fn895" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref895" role="doc-noteref"><sup>895</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>that is, the Catholic Church, in which you too might be.<a href="#fn896" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref896" role="doc-noteref"><sup>896</sup></a> And yet by rebaptising you
      have chosen to cast your lot amongst adulterers.</p>
      <p>It has been most clearly proved by divine witness that you are
      sinners. It has also been shown that thine auxiliaries have warred
      against thee,<a href="#fn897" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref897" role="doc-noteref"><sup>897</sup></a> for thou hast brought up to
      thy relief <a href="#fn898" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref898" role="doc-noteref"><sup>898</sup></a> the saying of the
      Prophet:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The sacrifice of the sinner, is as of one who would offer in
      sacrifice a dog.’ <a href="#fn899" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref899" role="doc-noteref"><sup>899</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, if you have any shame, recognise with grief that
      <em>you</em> are the sinners.</p>
      <h3 id="in-what-sense-it-has-been-said-let-not-the-oil-of-the-sinner-anoint-my-head.">In
      what sense it has been said: Let not the oil of the sinner anoint
      My Head.</h3>
      <p>Also learn this, whose Word it is:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let not the oil of the sinner anoint My Head.’ <a href="#fn900" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref900" role="doc-noteref"><sup>900</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For whose voice is this thou hast not understood? It is surely
      the voice of Christ, who had not yet been anointed, when He prayed
      that the oil of the sinner should not soil His Head. Thou hast
      said, without understanding, that David the Prophet feared the oil
      of the sinner.</p>
      <p>The Psalmist had already been anointed by Samuel. There was
      then no reason why he should be anointed a second time.
      Consequently it is the voice of Christ, which says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let not the oil of the sinner anoint My Head.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is a prayer, not a command; the expression of a desire, not
      a precept. For, were it a command, He would have said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The oil of the sinner <em>shall</em> not anoint My Head.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is therefore the Voice of the Son of God, even then fearing
      to meet the oil of the sinner, that is of any man whomsoever, for
      no man is without sin, but God alone. Accordingly His Son feared
      the oil of man, for it would have been shameful that God should be
      anointed by man. Accordingly He prays the Father that He should
      not be anointed by man, but by God the Father Himself. It is then
      the Son who asks; let us see whether the Father has granted the
      request.</p>
      <p>This the Holy Spirit points out and makes clear in the
      forty-fourth Psalm, wherein He says to the Son Himself:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The Lord thy God shall anoint Thee with the oil of gladness
      differently <a href="#fn901" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref901" role="doc-noteref"><sup>901</sup></a> from Thy fellows.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>His fellows had been the priests and kings of the Jews, each of
      whom was known to have been anointed by men. But, since it was
      right that the Son should be anointed by the Father—God by God—as
      the Son asked and the Spirit announced that it had been
      promised—this the Father fulfilled in the Jordan. For when the Son
      of God, our Saviour, came there, He was pointed out to John with
      these words <a href="#fn902" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref902" role="doc-noteref"><sup>902</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold the Lamb of God; He it is who taketh away the sins of
      the world.’ <a href="#fn903" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref903" role="doc-noteref"><sup>903</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He went down into the water, not that there was anything in God
      that could be cleansed, but the water had to come before the oil
      that was to come after, thus to commence and ordain and fulfil the
      Mysteries of Baptism.<a href="#fn904" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref904" role="doc-noteref"><sup>904</sup></a></p>
      <p>For when the waters went over Him, and He was held in the hands
      of John, the Mystery followed in due order, and the Father
      fulfilled that for which the Son had prayed, and the Holy Ghost
      had announced was to come. The Heaven was opened, as the Father
      anointed. Forthwith the spiritual oil descended in the likeness of
      a Dove, and sat upon His Head and flowed over Him. On this account
      He was first called Christ, when He was anointed by God the
      Father. And lest it might seem that the laying on of hands was
      lacking to Him, the Voice of God was heard, saying from the
      cloud:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘This is My well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a href="#fn905" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref905" role="doc-noteref"><sup>905</sup></a> Hear ye Him.’ <a href="#fn906" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref906" role="doc-noteref"><sup>906</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here, therefore, we find the meaning of that which was
      written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let not the oil of the sinner anoint My Head.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Learn, then, though late, my brother Parmenian, the nature of
      the truth, for now is the time for learning how to find it.<a href="#fn907" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref907" role="doc-noteref"><sup>907</sup></a></p>
      <h3 id="that-heretics-are-children-of-adulterers.">That heretics
      are children of adulterers.</h3>
      <p>And with regard to that which you have quoted from the Prophet
      Solomon <a href="#fn908" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref908" role="doc-noteref"><sup>908</sup></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, and
      bastard slips cannot take deep roots,’</p>

      <p>this may well be understood to have been said in a literal
      sense. For, if you take it figuratively, you have excused those
      who are actually guilty of adultery. But grant that it was said in

      sacraments are like invalid wedlock, in whose beds is to be found
      iniquity, where the very seeds <span>[</span>of life<span>]</span>
      have been corrupted to the destruction of the Faith.<a href="#fn909" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref909" role="doc-noteref"><sup>909</sup></a></p>
      <p>When Valentinus maintains that the Son of God was on earth in a

      followers. The seed of <span>[</span>spiritual<span>]</span> birth
      has been rooted out in those who have not believed that the Son of
      God was born in the Flesh of Mary the Virgin, and that in the
      Flesh He suffered.</p>
      <h3 id="that-a-certain-passage-in-jeremiah-is-to-be-understood-of-the-idolatrous-jews.">That
      a certain passage in Jeremiah is to be understood of the
      idolatrous Jews.</h3>
      <p>Now with regard to what you mention that you have read in the
      Prophet Jeremiah that the people of God have done two evil things
      in that</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘they forsook the Fountain of living water, and digged to
      themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water’ <a href="#fn910" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref910" role="doc-noteref"><sup>910</sup></a>;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>you have indeed read this, but have been unwilling to
      understand the real state of the case.</p>
      <p>In your love for bringing charges, you have twisted round
      everything so as to abuse Catholics, and, to suit your own
      purposes, you have attempted to digress a great deal according to
      your own whims.<a href="#fn911" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref911" role="doc-noteref"><sup>911</sup></a> For if you imagine that
      everything which has been written by the Prophets belongs to our
      own times, you are making excuses for the Jews, concerning whom it
      is certain that it was written, that they forsook the Living God,
      the True God, the God who had bestowed His Blessings upon them,
      and made for themselves idols—that is to say, broken cisterns,
      which can hold no water.</p>
      <p>In God the Everlasting Majesty flows over,<a href="#fn912" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref912" role="doc-noteref"><sup>912</sup></a> even as, in a fountain,
      water freely gushes forth from its channels. But idols, unless
      they be made, have no being, and wells, unless they be dug, hold
      no water in their depth.<a href="#fn913" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref913" role="doc-noteref"><sup>913</sup></a> Cisterns
      cannot be hollowed out without skill and tools, nor can idols be
      made without a craftsman. In idols there is no virtue that belongs
      to them,<a href="#fn914" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref914" role="doc-noteref"><sup>914</sup></a> but it is given and applied
      to them through the mistake of man. Virtue is believed to be in an
      idol, which is not there of its own nature. A cistern, the making
      of which is a weary work,<a href="#fn915" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref915" role="doc-noteref"><sup>915</sup></a> is broken with
      deliberation, so that neither has it water of itself, nor of
      itself can it hold the water that it has received. Similarly an
      idol is not anything of itself, and, whilst it is being
      worshipped, is nothing.</p>
      <p>This is the meaning of the Word of God, that His people did two
      evil things, in that they abandoned the fountain of living water
      and made for themselves broken cisterns which they had themselves
      dug out. For the people of Israel had forsaken the true water, had
      not recognised the Divine Majesty, and had followed the evil
      worship of idols.</p>
      <p>This it is over which God grieves, this it is at which He says
      that the Heaven has shuddered.</p>
      <p>For God grieves over the same thing through the Prophet Isaiah,
      when in this matter He calls to witness two elements with these
      words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Hear, O Heaven, and perceive with thine ears, O Earth. I have
      brought up and have exalted children. But they have forsaken Me.’
      <a href="#fn916" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref916" role="doc-noteref"><sup>916</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>How is it, my brother Parmenian, that you have had nothing to
      say concerning this passage? Or why is it that there is here no
      mention of water? It will be seen that, through your love of
      fault-finding, you have done such violence to the Law, that,
      whenever you read anything of water, you have, by some conjuring
      tricks, twisted it round for your purposes of hatred, and have
      made a sort of drag-net out of malicious arguments, and have thus
      drawn to yourself all things which in themselves are good.</p>
      <p>For what intelligence have you shown <a href="#fn917" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref917" role="doc-noteref"><sup>917</sup></a> with regard to this passage
      in Jeremy, since God cries out that He has been forsaken, and that
      cisterns have thus been made? His wrath is concerning Himself, not
      concerning something which is His, for the Baptismal Water belongs
      to God, but is not God Himself.<a href="#fn918" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref918" role="doc-noteref"><sup>918</sup></a> And if you think that you
      <span>[</span>and your baptism<span>]</span> have been deserted,
      pray when were any of you baptised <a href="#fn919" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref919" role="doc-noteref"><sup>919</sup></a> among us, so that it should
      be true that they who deserted your

      <h3 id="from-parmenians-own-principles-it-follows-that-baptism-is-one.">From
      Parmenian’s own principles it follows that Baptism is One.</h3>
      <p>In our First Book we have shown by the clearest proofs who were
      the Betrayers of the Law <a href="#fn921" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref921" role="doc-noteref"><sup>921</sup></a> and the
      originators of the schism; in the Second we have pointed out that
      with us is the One True Catholic Church, whilst in the Third we
      have proved that whatever is said to have been done with severity
      cannot rightfully be in any way ascribed to us. We have also
      maintained <a href="#fn922" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref922" role="doc-noteref"><sup>922</sup></a> that there is divine warrant
      for saying that it is you,<a href="#fn923" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref923" role="doc-noteref"><sup>923</sup></a> rather than
      we, who are ‘sinners.’ <a href="#fn924" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref924" role="doc-noteref"><sup>924</sup></a></p>
      <p>We must now <a href="#fn925" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref925" role="doc-noteref"><sup>925</sup></a> in this place speak of
      Baptism. In the matter at present to be considered the whole
      question consists in this, that you have dared to do violence <a href="#fn926" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref926" role="doc-noteref"><sup>926</sup></a> to Baptism—that you have
      repeated what Christ has commanded to be done but once.</p>
      <p>And this, my brother Parmenian, you do not deny, since at the
      beginning of your treatise you have said many things which are on
      our side, and tell for us, but against you.<a href="#fn927" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref927" role="doc-noteref"><sup>927</sup></a> Thus with reference to
      Baptism, you have mentioned that there was only one Flood, and
      only one Circumcision for the people of the Jews. But although you
      dealt with these subjects at the beginning of your oration,<a href="#fn928" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref928" role="doc-noteref"><sup>928</sup></a> as the sermon was developed
      <a href="#fn929" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref929" role="doc-noteref"><sup>929</sup></a> you soon forgot all about
      them, and introduced two waters; so you made a silly commencement
      to your argument, for you knew that you were going on to discuss
      the true water and the false.<a href="#fn930" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref930" role="doc-noteref"><sup>930</sup></a></p>
      <p>You strengthen the oneness of Holy Baptism, when trying to
      weaken it <a href="#fn931" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref931" role="doc-noteref"><sup>931</sup></a>; for you have wished to lay
      as it were a foundation, with regard to the Jewish Circumcision,
      that the Baptism of Christians had been foreshadowed in the
      Circumcision of the Hebrews. In this way you have defended, whilst
      attacking, the Catholic Church. As your treatise progressed, you
      claimed to empty of value one kind of Baptism,<a href="#fn932" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref932" role="doc-noteref"><sup>932</sup></a> that you might fill the
      other to the full.<a href="#fn933" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref933" role="doc-noteref"><sup>933</sup></a> By saying that
      (apart from the Baptism of heretics<a href="#fn934" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref934" role="doc-noteref"><sup>934</sup></a>), there is one Baptism and
      yet a second,<a href="#fn935" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref935" role="doc-noteref"><sup>935</sup></a> you could not deny—although
      you have tried to show that they are different <a href="#fn936" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref936" role="doc-noteref"><sup>936</sup></a> —that they are two; when you
      endeavoured to remove one of these,<a href="#fn937" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref937" role="doc-noteref"><sup>937</sup></a> you laboured to treat the
      second <a href="#fn938" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref938" role="doc-noteref"><sup>938</sup></a> as though it were the
      first.<a href="#fn939" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref939" role="doc-noteref"><sup>939</sup></a> But before the coming of
      Baptism, Circumcision was sent forward in advance in a figure. Yet
      you have maintained that there are amongst Christians two waters.
      Show then that there are also two Circumcisions amongst the
      Jews—of which one was the better, the other the worse. If you
      search for this, you will not be able to find it. The family <a href="#fn940" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref940" role="doc-noteref"><sup>940</sup></a> of Abraham—by descent from
      whom men are judged to be Jews—glory in being marked with this
      seal. Therefore the truth ought afterwards to follow, like in
      character to its figure,<a href="#fn941" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref941" role="doc-noteref"><sup>941</sup></a> which was sent
      on before. For God too, who wished to show that the reality to
      come (when the truth should follow the type) must be something
      unique,<a href="#fn942" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref942" role="doc-noteref"><sup>942</sup></a> willed not that anything
      should be removed from the ear, nor from the finger; but that part
      of the body was chosen where what had been once cut away <a href="#fn943" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref943" role="doc-noteref"><sup>943</sup></a> should leave them with a
      sign that is to our point, because it cannot be removed a second
      time. For when this is done once it preserves health; if done
      again it may do harm. Similarly, Christian Baptism, effected by
      the Trinity,<a href="#fn944" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref944" role="doc-noteref"><sup>944</sup></a> confers grace; if it be
      repeated it causes loss of life.</p>
      <p>What then has come over you,<a href="#fn945" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref945" role="doc-noteref"><sup>945</sup></a> my brother Parmenian, to
      bring forward a thing which is one,<a href="#fn946" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref946" role="doc-noteref"><sup>946</sup></a> and over against it <a href="#fn947" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref947" role="doc-noteref"><sup>947</sup></a> to compare two Baptisms
      (even though you allege that they are different)—the one true, the
      other false? For in this way you have proceeded to argue that
      there are two waters, and claiming one as true for yourselves,
      wished to ascribe the other to us as false.<a href="#fn948" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref948" role="doc-noteref"><sup>948</sup></a></p>
      <p>After this you have made mention also of the Flood.<a href="#fn949" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref949" role="doc-noteref"><sup>949</sup></a> This was indeed a figure of
      Baptism, inasmuch as the whole sin-stained world, after the
      sinners had been drowned, was, through the intervention of
      washing,<a href="#fn950" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref950" role="doc-noteref"><sup>950</sup></a> restored—cleansed—to its
      former appearance.<a href="#fn951" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref951" role="doc-noteref"><sup>951</sup></a> But since you
      were going to say that (besides <a href="#fn952" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref952" role="doc-noteref"><sup>952</sup></a> the muddy <a href="#fn953" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref953" role="doc-noteref"><sup>953</sup></a> fountains of the heretics)
      there was another water—that is a lying <a href="#fn954" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref954" role="doc-noteref"><sup>954</sup></a> water in opposition to the
      true—to what purpose have you thought well to refer to the Flood,
      which happened but once? But as you will have it so,<a href="#fn955" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref955" role="doc-noteref"><sup>955</sup></a> show first two Arks unlike
      one another, and two dissimilar doves, bearing different branches
      in their mouth—that is, if you are to prove that there is a true
      water and another which is false.</p>
      <p>That water alone is true which has been sanctified <a href="#fn956" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref956" role="doc-noteref"><sup>956</sup></a> not from any place, nor by
      any <span>[</span>human<span>]</span> person,<a href="#fn957" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref957" role="doc-noteref"><sup>957</sup></a> but by the Trinity. And, as
      you have said that there is a water which is lying,<a href="#fn958" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref958" role="doc-noteref"><sup>958</sup></a> learn where you may find
      such—with Praxeas, the Patripassian, who totally <a href="#fn959" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref959" role="doc-noteref"><sup>959</sup></a> denies the Son, and
      maintains that the Father has suffered.</p>
      <p>Since the Son of God is Truth—as He Himself bears witness,
      saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I am the Door, and the Way and the Truth’ <a href="#fn960" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref960" role="doc-noteref"><sup>960</sup></a> —</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>therefore—if the Son of God is Truth—where He is not, there is
      a lie. And as the Son is not with the Patripassian, there the
      Truth is not, and where the Truth is not, there the water is
      lying. So, though late, cease now to concoct accusations,<a href="#fn961" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref961" role="doc-noteref"><sup>961</sup></a> and do not transfer to
      Catholics that which was said against Patripassians.</p>
      <p>It has, then, been clearly demonstrated that what you have said
      of the Flood and of Circumcision might have been said just as well
      by us as in support of your side.<a href="#fn962" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref962" role="doc-noteref"><sup>962</sup></a></p>
      <p>It remains to show that you have praised Baptism in such a way
      as to bring forward many things which tell both for you and for
      us, but something that tells against you. Whatever we share with
      you is in favour of both. For this reason does it favour you,
      because from us you went out. Thus, for example, you and we have
      one ecclesiastical discipline,<a href="#fn963" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref963" role="doc-noteref"><sup>963</sup></a> we read from the same
      Scriptures,<a href="#fn964" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref964" role="doc-noteref"><sup>964</sup></a> we possess the same Faith,
      the same Sacraments of Faith, the same Mysteries. With reason,
      therefore, have you praised Baptism, for who amongst the Faithful
      is unaware that the one Baptism <a href="#fn965" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref965" role="doc-noteref"><sup>965</sup></a> is life for virtues, death
      to evil deeds,<a href="#fn966" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref966" role="doc-noteref"><sup>966</sup></a> birth to immortality, the
      attainment of the heavenly kingdom, the harbour of innocence, and
      (as you too have said) the shipwreck of sins <a href="#fn967" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref967" role="doc-noteref"><sup>967</sup></a>? These are the blessings
      conferred upon every believer, not by the minister of this
      Sacrament, but by the Faith of him who believes and by the
      Trinity.</p>
      <h3 id="that-in-baptism-the-work-is-done-by-the-trinity-not-by-the-person-of-the-minister.">That
      in Baptism the work is done by the Trinity, not by the person of
      the Minister.</h3>
      <p>Then you will ask what you have, when praising Baptism, said
      against yourselves. Listen! But first you must acknowledge
      something which not one of you will be able to deny.<a href="#fn968" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref968" role="doc-noteref"><sup>968</sup></a> You say that the Trinity
      counts for nothing,<a href="#fn969" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref969" role="doc-noteref"><sup>969</sup></a> unless you be
      present.<a href="#fn970" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref970" role="doc-noteref"><sup>970</sup></a></p>
      <p>If you think little of us,<a href="#fn971" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref971" role="doc-noteref"><sup>971</sup></a> at least
      reverence the Lord, who is First in the Trinity,<a href="#fn972" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref972" role="doc-noteref"><sup>972</sup></a> who with His Son and the
      Holy Ghost effects and completes all things,<a href="#fn973" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref973" role="doc-noteref"><sup>973</sup></a> even when no human person is
      present.</p>
      <p>But, my brother Parmenian, you have said in praise of the
      water, of which we read in the Book of Genesis, that the waters
      first gave forth living beings’.<a href="#fn974" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref974" role="doc-noteref"><sup>974</sup></a> Could they have given them
      birth of their own instance <a href="#fn975" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref975" role="doc-noteref"><sup>975</sup></a>? Was not the
      whole Trinity there as well? Surely God the Father was there—He
      who had deigned to command:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Let the waters bring forth swimming things, birds and the
      rest.’ <a href="#fn976" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref976" role="doc-noteref"><sup>976</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But if that which was then done were to be done without any to
      effect it,<a href="#fn977" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref977" role="doc-noteref"><sup>977</sup></a> God would have said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘O waters, bring forth.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the Son of God—who effected it <a href="#fn978" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref978" role="doc-noteref"><sup>978</sup></a> —was there. The Holy Ghost
      was there, as it has been written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘And the Spirit of God was borne over the waters.’ <a href="#fn979" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref979" role="doc-noteref"><sup>979</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I see nothing there which is a fourth—nothing less than the
      Three.<a href="#fn980" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref980" role="doc-noteref"><sup>980</sup></a> Yet that which the Trinity
      effected came to birth, although you were not there. If then it be
      not allowed to the Trinity to do anything without you, call back
      the fishes to their first beginning <a href="#fn981" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref981" role="doc-noteref"><sup>981</sup></a>; if in your absence the
      Trinity may not effect anything, drown in the waters the birds as

      <h3 id="that-baptism-is-not-to-be-repeated.">That Baptism is not

      <p>Since then you have said that there was only one Deluge and
      that Circumcision could not be repeated, whilst we have taught

      on earth (although even now He is not absent), gave His orders to
      the Apostles with regard to whatever was necessary for the time.
      But just as an earthly father, who feels himself to be on the
      borderland of death, and fears lest his sons may break peace after
      his death, and go to law, calls in witnesses and transfers his
      will from his breast, so soon to pass away, to a record which will
      last for a long time <a href="#fn990" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref990" role="doc-noteref"><sup>990</sup></a> —and should
      any dispute arise amongst the brothers, they do not go to the

      whom the testament belongs, is in heaven—therefore let His Will be
      sought in the Gospel as in His testament. <a href="#fn991" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref991" role="doc-noteref"><sup>991</sup></a></p>
      <p>For through His foreknowledge Christ had foreseen the things
      which you do now, but which were then yet to come. Accordingly,
      when the Son of God washed the feet of His disciples, He spoke
      thus to Peter:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘That which I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know
      afterwards.’ <a href="#fn992" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref992" role="doc-noteref"><sup>992</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>By saying ‘thou shalt know afterwards’ He pointed out these
      present times. In this way amongst other prescriptions of His
      testament, <a href="#fn993" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref993" role="doc-noteref"><sup>993</sup></a> He gave this prescription <a href="#fn994" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref994" role="doc-noteref"><sup>994</sup></a> concerning the Water. If,
      when He washed the feet of His disciples, and the others were
      silent, Peter had also been silent, He would have set the example
      of humility only,<a href="#fn995" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref995" role="doc-noteref"><sup>995</sup></a> and would have
      made no declaration respecting the Sacrament of Baptism. But when
      Peter refuses, and does not allow his feet to be washed, Christ
      refuses him the Kingdom, unless he should accept this service.<a href="#fn996" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref996" role="doc-noteref"><sup>996</sup></a> But so soon as there is
      mention of the heavenly Kingdom—whereas part of his body was

      body to be cleansed.<a href="#fn997" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref997" role="doc-noteref"><sup>997</sup></a></p>

      When Peter makes his appeal,<a href="#fn999" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref999" role="doc-noteref"><sup>999</sup></a> Christ

      <p>And thus did He make His declaration concerning that washing <a href="#fn1001" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1001" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1001</sup></a> which he had commanded to

      <p>For thus the Lord Himself commanded, when He said:</p>

      <p>‘Go, baptise all nations in the Name of the Father and of the
      Son and of the Holy Ghost.’ <a href="#fn1005" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1005" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1005</sup></a></p>

      <p>This was the washing <a href="#fn1006" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1006" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1006</sup></a> of which He
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He that has been washed once has no need of being washed a
      second time.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In saying <em>once</em> He forbade it to be done again, and
      spoke of the thing, not of the person.<a href="#fn1007" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1007" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1007</sup></a> For if there had been a

      <p>but by not adding the word <em>rightly,</em> He points out that
      whatever has been done in the <span>[</span>Name of

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He has no need of being washed a second time,’</p>

      <p>this is a general, not a particular declaration,<a href="#fn1011" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1011" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1011</sup></a> for if these things had

      <p>Do you then, who seem to take delight<a href="#fn1021" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1021" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1021</sup></a> in striving to make Baptism
      twofold, if you give a second Baptism, give a second Faith; if you
      give a second Faith, give also a second Christ; if you give a

      <p>You cannot deny that God is one—unless indeed you would fall
      into the traps of Marcion.<a href="#fn1022" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1022" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1022</sup></a> God then is

      <p>It follows then that Baptism is one, and, as, through the very
      fact that it is one, it is holy, so also, through the very fact
      that it is one, not only that it should be separated from the
      profane and sacrilegious baptisms of heretics, but also that what
      is one should not be made twofold, and that what is for once only

      <p>It is clear that in the celebration of this Sacrament of
      Baptism there are three elements,<a href="#fn1032" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1032" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1032</sup></a> which you will not be able
      either to decrease or diminish, or put on one side. The first is
      in the Trinity, the second in the believer,<a href="#fn1033" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1033" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1033</sup></a> the third in him who
      operates.<a href="#fn1034" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1034" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1034</sup></a> But they must not all be

      holds the chief place, without whom the work itself cannot be

      office of the ‘Minister,’ <a href="#fn1037" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1037" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1037</sup></a> which cannot
      be of equal authority. The first two remain always unchangeable
      and unmoved. For the Trinity is always Itself; and the Faith is
      the same in everyone.<a href="#fn1038" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1038" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1038</sup></a> Both
      <span>[</span>the Trinity and Faith<span>]</span> always preserve

      other two elements <a href="#fn1040" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1040" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1040</sup></a>
      <span>[</span>in the Sacrament of Baptism<span>]</span>, because
      it alone is liable to change.</p>
      <p>You will have it that between you and us there is a
      distinction, though the office is the same,<a href="#fn1041" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1041" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1041</sup></a> and, judging yourselves to
      be more holy than we, you do not hesitate to place your pride

      be eagerly sought after.</p>
      <p>Since you are—amongst others—’ Ministers’ of the Sacrament,
      show what is the nature of the place that you occupy in this
      Mystery, and whether you can belong to its ‘body’!</p>
      <p>The Name of Baptism is but one.<a href="#fn1043" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1043" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1043</sup></a> It possesses its own

      has its own well-defined members,<a href="#fn1045" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1045" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1045</sup></a> to which nothing can be
      added, in which nothing can be taken away. If the ‘Minister’ who
      has to be chosen is counted as one of these members,<a href="#fn1046" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1046" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1046</sup></a> then the whole body belongs
      to the ‘Minister.’ All these members are both at all times and
      once for all with this ‘body,’ and cannot be changed, whereas the
      ‘Ministers’ are changed every day, both as to place and time, and
      in their own persons.<a href="#fn1047" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1047" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1047</sup></a> For it is

      you think otherwise, you are endeavouring to make of no effect the
      words of the Prophets and the promises of God, by which it is
      proved that it is God, not man, who cleanses. Here David the

      <p>He said: ‘Wash me.’ He did not say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Choose for me one by whom I may be washed.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And the Prophet Isaiah also has written that</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘the Lord shall wash away the defilement of the sons and
      daughters of Sion.’ <a href="#fn1052" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1052" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1052</sup></a></p>

      <p>We have proved in our Third Book that Sion is the Church <a href="#fn1053" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1053" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1053</sup></a>; it follows that God washes
      the sons and daughters of the Church. He did not say:</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Admit then that the Prophets overcome you, or, with them,
      recognise that it is not man who washes, but God.</p>

      in what part of a man it dwells. To know this has not been granted
      to any. How, then, do you think that it is you who cleanse, when
      you do not know the nature of that which you cleanse? It belongs
      not to man, but to God to cleanse, for He has Himself promised
      that He will cleanse, through the Prophet Isaiah, when He
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Even though your sins are like scarlet, I will make you white
      as snow.’ <a href="#fn1060" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1060" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1060</sup></a></p>

      <p>and not:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I will cause you to be made white.’</p>

      <p>If this has been promised by God, why do you wish to give that
      which it is not permitted to you either to promise, or to give, or
      to have? Behold by Isaiah God has promised Himself to wash those

      would give. He Himself, therefore, it is who gives, and that which
      is given is His own. What, therefore, is it which you strive, with
      absolute unreasonableness,<a href="#fn1064" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1064" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1064</sup></a> to vindicate

      <h3 id="why-and-when-the-baptism-of-christ-was-conferred.">Why and
      when the Baptism of Christ was conferred.</h3>
      <p>To give the final proof concerning this matter, John the
      Baptist, the forerunner of the Saviour, when he was baptising many
      to repentance and the remission of their sins,<a href="#fn1065" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1065" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1065</sup></a> declared that the Son of
      God was about to come. These are his words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold, He cometh to baptise you.’ <a href="#fn1066" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1066" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1066</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yet we do not read that Christ rebaptised anyone after John.
      With regard, therefore, to these words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He cometh to baptise you,’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Christ coming after John baptised no one. This promise was made
      for our times, that He might give what is given to-day, according
      to His Word:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘He who shall drink the water which I give shall not thirst for
      ever.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And although the disciples of John said to their master:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold He, whom thou hast baptised, baptises.’ <a href="#fn1067" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1067" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1067</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He baptised indeed, but by the hands of His Apostles, to whom
      He had given the laws of Baptism. As it has been written in
      another place:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘For He Himself baptised no one, but His disciples baptised.’
      <a href="#fn1068" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1068" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1068</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In this matter we are all His disciples, so that we should
      work,<a href="#fn1069" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1069" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1069</sup></a> in order that He may give,
      who promised that He would give. Still, when John was baptising
      many <a href="#fn1070" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1070" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1070</sup></a> thousands of men, even in
      the presence of Christ, the servant worked, and the Lord did
      nothing <a href="#fn1071" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1071" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1071</sup></a> until He gave the Form of
      Baptism.<a href="#fn1072" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1072" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1072</sup></a> After the lapse of a
      considerable period,<a href="#fn1073" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1073" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1073</sup></a> thousands of
      men were washed in repentance and forgiveness of sins. But no one
      was washed in the Trinity, no one yet knew Christ, no one had
      heard that there was a Holy Ghost. But when there came the
      fullness of time, at a fixed moment, the Son of God gave the laws
      of Baptism. He gave also the way by which we might go to the
      Kingdom of Heaven, for He then commanded:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Go ye, teach all nations, baptising them in the Name of the
      Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.’ <a href="#fn1074" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1074" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1074</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>From that day what He had commanded had to be done. It was not
      His will to amend that which had been done before that time, lest
      He might <span>[</span>seem to<span>]</span> give permission to
      rebaptise—although the Baptism of John was one thing, and the
      Baptism of Christ is another. Before His law <span>[</span>was
      given<span>]</span> He willed the Baptism of John, which was not
      full, to be held for full. And yet with regard to the thousands of
      men mentioned above, although they knew not the Son of God and the
      Holy Ghost, He could not refuse them the Kingdom of Heaven,
      because they had believed in God. So it is the Voice of the Son of
      God, who says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘From the days of John to this day the Kingdom of Heaven
      suffereth violence, and they who do violence bear it away.’ <a href="#fn1075" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1075" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1075</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For this reason does He say:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘They who do violence,’ <a href="#fn1076" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1076" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1076</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>because John was still baptising. So, because the time before
      His commandments <a href="#fn1077" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1077" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1077</sup></a> was
      different from the time after His commandments, they who have been
      baptised in the Name of the Saviour after the commandments,<a href="#fn1078" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1078" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1078</sup></a> have entered the Kingdom,

      <span>[</span>of Baptism<span>]</span>, whilst those who were

      not shut out. Therefore, though before the commandments,<a href="#fn1081" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1081" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1081</sup></a> the Baptism of John was
      imperfect, it was judged by Him, in whose place no man judges,<a href="#fn1082" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1082" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1082</sup></a> as though it were
      perfect,<a href="#fn1083" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1083" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1083</sup></a> because a certain line of

      <p>but</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>and you inveigh against the characters of men, and wish to
      repeat what is for once only. They who had been baptised at
      Ephesus, had believed in repentance and the forgiveness of sins.
      Rightly was it said to them, that they should be baptised in the
      Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. But what
      is there for you to change in men, who have already made
      profession <a href="#fn1108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1108</sup></a> that they believe in the

      <p>I return now to that question of yours:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘How is he, who has not anything to give, able to give?’</p>

      <p>Whence comes this saying? Where can it be found? It has not

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘How is he, who has not anything to give, able to give?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These words have not been written in the Law, for if (as you
      will have it) it is man who gives, God does nothing—and if God
      does nothing, and if everything that has to be given is in your
      hands, then <span>[</span>the baptised<span>]</span> are converted
      to you. Let those whom you baptise be washed in your name. Blush
      at the most blessed Paul, who cries out and expresses his
      thanksgiving:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Have you been baptised in my name?’ <a href="#fn1111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1111</sup></a></p>

      <p>He rejoices that he baptised only two persons and one
      household, but you strive to rebaptise whole peoples, and are
      contented <a href="#fn1112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1112</sup></a> both to have sinned in the
      past, and to go on sinning, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘What does he give, who has not anything to give?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He, in whom we believe, is Himself the giver of that in which
      we believe, not another through whose instrumentality we are
      brought to believe.<a href="#fn1113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1113</sup></a> Besides,
      under John a vast <a href="#fn1114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1114</sup></a> multitude of
      men were baptised. Prove (if you can) that John either received,
      or possessed, anything to give.</p>
      <p>He was the ‘Minister’ <a href="#fn1115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1115</sup></a>; the gift
      was from God, who does not fail in giving. And now whilst we all

      <p>So consider how ridiculous is that saying, which is always
      heard to come from you, as though for your glorification:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘This gift of Baptism belongs to him who gives, not to him who
      receives.’ <a href="#fn1117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1117</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And would that you should say this of God, who is the true
      Giver.<a href="#fn1118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1118</sup></a> But—a stupid thing—you say
      that you are the givers. If this be so, suppose that both you and

      <p>On the other hand, let us who, as you will have it, are
      sinners, ask the other Pagan, whether he renounces the Devil, and
      believes God and the other questions, and we will suppose that he
      says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I do renounce and I do believe, and the rest’ <a href="#fn1122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1122</sup></a> —</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>will you tell me when you baptise the one who is unwilling, and
      we baptise the other who is willing, which of these two can arrive
      at the grace of God?</p>
      <p>Surely, without doubt, it is acquired by the one who believes,
      not by him, in whose case, as you say, your holiness takes the
      place of his own will.<a href="#fn1123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1123</sup></a> Recognise,

      to your challenge, compare human arts with things that are

      <p>When something is dyed with a precious colour, its nature is

      passes into the royal purple, so the catechumen passes into the
      Christian.<a href="#fn1125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1125</sup></a> Surely, whilst he begins to
      be that which he was not, he ceases to be that which he was. The

      gift that has made that man a Christian.</p>
      <p>If this is all your doing, then the workman also who makes the
      purple, may say that he has the precious colour in his own hands,
      and has no need to procure from the Ocean precious dyes—unknown to
      many—that the fleeces may be promoted to a marvellous dignity,<a href="#fn1128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1128</sup></a> and is free to assert that
      he can make the purple, merely by his touch, without admixture
      from the blood of the fish.</p>
      <p>But if on the contrary this workman is unable to give the
      colour by his touch alone, then neither is the workman in Baptism
      able to give anything of himself without the Trinity.</p>
      <p>Such is this question, about which we have our present
      contention. For in Whom the nations should be baptised has been
      ordained by the Saviour. Through whom they should be baptised was
      appointed without the making of any exception. He did not say to
      the Apostles:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Do it you! Let not others do it.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Whosoever has baptised in the Name of the Father and of the Son
      and of the Holy Ghost, has discharged the Apostles’ work.</p>
      <p>And so it has been written in the Gospel.<a href="#fn1129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1129</sup></a> When John said:</p>

      the ridges under his feet) pour water upon them. He is able to dig

      alone from the pith of vine-branches to bring forth roots which

      <p>Even as the blessed Apostle Paul, to tame your presumption and

      think either that he has any dominion over Baptism, or claim any

      follows, showing that all belongs to God:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Neither he that plants nor he that waters is anything, but God
      alone, who leads to the attainment of the increase <a href="#fn1144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1144</sup></a>.’</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>The nations flock to receive His grace. He, who deigned to
      invite, is the giver thereof. A crowd of His servants exercise
      their ministry. Thanks must be rendered, not to those who serve,
      but to Him who provides the repast. Since you are the ministers,

      ownership of the banquet,<a href="#fn1151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1151</sup></a> though the
      most blessed Paul confesses with humility that he and the others

      the Apostle:</p>

      <p>It remains <a href="#fn1156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1156</sup></a> now to say
      something of the merit of the believer, to whom belongs the faith,
      which the Son of God placed before both His Sanctity and Majesty.
      For you cannot be more holy than is Christ. When that woman, whose
      daughter was dead, came to Him, and besought that she should be
      restored to life, He promised nothing of His own Power,<a href="#fn1157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1157</sup></a> but asked about the faith
      of another, so that if the woman believed, her daughter should be
      raised up, in view of her mother’s faith <a href="#fn1158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1158</sup></a>; but that if she believed
      not, the Power of the Son of God would be idle, with nothing to
      do.<a href="#fn1159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1159</sup></a> The woman is questioned.
      She replies that she believed that what she had asked for could be
      accomplished. She is ordered to depart. She returns to her house,
      and finds the daughter alive whom she had left dead. She does not
      rush to kisses, she does not hasten to embraces, but returns to
      render thanks to the Saviour. And the Son of God, that He might
      show that He had stood by,<a href="#fn1160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1160</sup></a> and that her
      faith alone had worked, said to her:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘O woman, depart in peace. Thy faith hath made thee whole.’ <a href="#fn1161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1161</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What comes of your saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘It is of the giver, not of the receiver’ <a href="#fn1162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1162</sup></a>?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And what think you of the centurion’s faith? He besought the
      Saviour to ward off death from his son, when he was ill. Christ
      then went to the dying boy. In such estimation did the centurion
      hold Him, that he acknowledged the unworthiness of his house, and
      begged that the Son of God would not enter it in person,<a href="#fn1163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1163</sup></a> but that He should send His
      Power, by which death might be put to flight, and the lad be
      restored to life. It was not the valour of the centurion, nor his
      wisdom that was praised, but his faith:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘And his son was cured at that hour.’ <a href="#fn1164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1164</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Of a truth it is ‘of the giver,’ not of him that receives! <a href="#fn1165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1165</sup></a> There are many things of
      this kind in the Gospel about perfect faith, but we must finish
      the story of at least three witnesses to Faith.<a href="#fn1166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1166</sup></a></p>
      <p>What think you of that woman, who, after she had been ill for
      twelve years of a hidden malady, belonging to women, and had spent
      all her substance upon doctors,<a href="#fn1167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1167</sup></a> on beholding so many
      wonderful works <a href="#fn1168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1168</sup></a> performed by
      the Son of God, went into the crowd, saw the physician, saw also
      the people? Her pain <a href="#fn1169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1169</sup></a> urged her on
      to ask for medicine, shame hindered her from disclosing, in the
      presence of men, the cause of her complaint. Her silent faith told
      her what to do.<a href="#fn1170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1170</sup></a></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I will send forth my hand,’ <span>[</span>she
      said<span>]</span> ‘and I will touch the hem of His garment and I
      shall be healed.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When no one observed her, in the midst of the crowd she put
      forth her hand. She touched and was healed. But she did not
      venture to tell aloud that for which she had not ventured to ask.
      However, that the fruit of her faith might not be hidden from
      those who were unaware of it, the Saviour asked:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Who has touched Me?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>His disciples marvelled and said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The crowds press on Thee, yet Thou dost ask, “Who has touched
      Me?” ’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and Christ asked:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Who, I say, has touched Me? I have felt that virtue has gone
      forth from Me.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the woman acknowledged that she it was who had touched Him
      and been healed. In the other cases the mother had asked for her
      daughter, the centurion had asked for his son. Here neither did
      the woman ask, nor did Christ promise, but faith obtained all that
      it anticipated.<a href="#fn1171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1171</sup></a> Without

      to their birth.<a href="#fn1173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1173" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1173</sup></a> What has

      should refuse to receive the most gentle grace of the saving

      changed and softened into the flesh of an infant. But, with regard
      to this business, which we are at present discussing together, to
      what purpose have you recalled such a history as this <a href="#fn1178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1178" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1178</sup></a>? For we do hot read here <a href="#fn1179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1179" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1179</sup></a> that anyone had washed that
      leprous Syrian before the word or at the command <a href="#fn1180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1180" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1180</sup></a> of Elisha, in such a way
      that he might be duly washed again to his greater advantage.<a href="#fn1181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1181" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1181</sup></a> But even if it were so,
      still, it would not serve your purpose,<a href="#fn1182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1182" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1182</sup></a> as something which you
      might lawfully imitate. For we do not read that he had first
      washed in the waters of Syria, or that he had been washed by
      anyone, without gaining thereby any advantage. But if it had been
      so, this would not appertain to the praise of Elisha (who did not
      wash him, but gave him advice); rather would it redound to the
      glory of the Jordan that the first <a href="#fn1183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1183</sup></a> grace came to the Syrian <a href="#fn1184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1184" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1184</sup></a> —in that river wherein

      <p>Lastly what is to be said with regard to that part of your
      treatise concerning the heavenly nuptials, in which—taking away
      hope of future things—you have applied it all to the present time,
      saying that he, who escaped your doorkeepers and ministers,<a href="#fn1186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1186</sup></a> has been cut off from your

      <p>For the Son of God, Christ Himself, is the Bridegroom; He is

      For what so sacrilegious as to break, to scrape, to take away
      altars of God, upon which you too once offered sacrifice,<a href="#fn1211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1211</sup></a> upon which were laid both
      the prayers of the people, and the Members of Christ,<a href="#fn1212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1212</sup></a> where Almighty God was
      called upon, where the Holy Spirit descended in answer to prayer,
      from which many have received the pledge of everlasting salvation,
      and the safeguard of faith, and the hope of resurrection? Altars,
      I say, upon which the Saviour forbade the gifts of the brotherhood
      <a href="#fn1213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1213" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1213</sup></a> to be laid, unless they
      should be seasoned with peace.<a href="#fn1214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1214" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1214</sup></a></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Lay down,’ He said, ‘thy gift before the altar,<a href="#fn1215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1215" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1215</sup></a> and go back, agree with thy
      brother, that the priest may be able to offer on thy behalf.’ <a href="#fn1216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1216" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1216</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For what is an altar excepting the seat of both the Body and
      the Blood of Christ? <a href="#fn1217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1217</sup></a></p>
      <p>All these altars you, in your madness, have either scraped, or
      broken, or taken away. Whatever reason you may have had prompting
      you to this wickedness (for which no atonement is possible), it
      should have been done in the same way
      <span>[</span>everywhere<span>]</span>. But in one place, the
      abundance of wood it was (as I think) that led to the altars being
      broken up, in other places the lack of timber caused them to be
      scraped, whilst yet again elsewhere it was partly the sense of
      shame, which induced men to take them away. But in each case a
      disgraceful wickedness was committed when you laid sacrilegious
      and impious hands upon so great a Thing.<a href="#fn1218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1218" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1218</sup></a></p>
      <p>Why should I mention the hired mob of abandoned wretches, and
      the wine that was given as the pay of crime? <a href="#fn1219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1219" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1219</sup></a> —the wine, for which a fire
      was made out of the broken remnants of the altars, that unclean
      lips might drink it <span>[</span>hot<span>]</span> with
      sacrilegious draughts? <a href="#fn1220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1220" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1220</sup></a> If in your

      God, who at those altars <a href="#fn1222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1222</sup></a> was once
      habitually invoked? In what way had Christ offended you, whose
      Body and Blood were wont during determinate times there to dwell
      <a href="#fn1223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1223</sup></a>? In what way had you
      yourselves even offended yourselves, that you should break down
      those altars, upon which before us you had (as you think, with
      sanctity) offered sacrifice for long periods of time? In impiously
      attacking our hands there, where the Body of Christ used to
      dwell,<a href="#fn1224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1224" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1224</sup></a> you have also smitten your
      own.<a href="#fn1225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1225" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1225</sup></a></p>
      <p>By thus acting you have imitated the Jews. They laid hands upon
      Christ on the cross; you have struck Him upon the altar.<a href="#fn1226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1226</sup></a> If you wished to attack
      Catholics at these altars, there <a href="#fn1227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1227" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1227</sup></a> you might have spared at
      least your own former sacrifices.<a href="#fn1228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1228" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1228</sup></a></p>
      <p>Thy <a href="#fn1229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1229</sup></a> pride has now been
      manifested in that place where formerly thou didst offer sacrifice
      with humility, there thou dost freely sin, where once thou wert
      accustomed to pray on behalf of the sins of many. After this
      fashion you <a href="#fn1230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1230</sup></a> have, of your own accord,
      entered into the company of sacrilegious priests, and are
      associated with the crimes of wicked men, concerning whom Elijah
      the prophet makes his plaint before the Lord. For he has used
      these words (with which you too, amongst others, have deserved to
      be accused by him):</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘O Lord,’ he says, ‘they have broken down Thine altars.’ <a href="#fn1231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1231" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1231</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When he says ‘Thine,’ he shows that the
      <span>[</span>altar<span>]</span> where any offering has been made
      to God by anyone whomsoever, belongs to God.<a href="#fn1232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1232" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1232</sup></a><a href="#fn1233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1233" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1233</sup></a></p>
      <p>It might have satisfied your madness, to have wounded the
      members of the Church, and to have divided by your beguilements
      the peoples of God, who were formerly placed in unity. Amongst all
      your other proceedings, you might at least have spared the altars.
      Why did you break, together with the altars themselves, the
      entreaties and longings of men? <a href="#fn1234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1234" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1234</sup></a><a href="#fn1235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1235" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1235</sup></a> For from them the people’s
      prayer was wont to go up to the ears of God. Why did you cut to
      pieces the road of their prayers to Him? <a href="#fn1236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1236" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1236</sup></a> With impious hands you have
      laboured in a sort of fashion to draw away the ladder,<a href="#fn1237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1237</sup></a> that you might prevent
      supplication ascending in the accustomed way to God.</p>
      <p>And though all of you shared in one conspiracy, still, in this
      matter, whilst your wrongdoing was the same, you carried it out by
      different methods.</p>
      <p>If it was sufficient to move, it was not lawful to break; if it
      was right to break, it is a sin to have scraped. For if, as your
      assembly decreed, it was not lawful <span>[</span>to preserve the
      altars<span>]</span>, that man who broke them up would seem to
      have acted rightly. In that case he is guilty who, by scraping,
      preserved the larger part of them.</p>
      <p>What is this new and foolish wisdom of yours to seek for that
      which is new in the very heart of that which is old <a href="#fn1238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1238</sup></a><a href="#fn1239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1239</sup></a>? It is as though, after
      having removed some skin from the body, you were to look, as it
      were, for a second skin in that part of the body which lay hid
      under the part which you had cut away.<a href="#fn1240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1240" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1240</sup></a> The gift <a href="#fn1241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1241" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1241</sup></a> which is proper to itself

      in itself, may, after something has been taken from it, be
      lessened. Changed it cannot be. You have, it is true, scraped what
      seemed good to you, but what you hate is still there! Again, even
      though you have agreed,<a href="#fn1243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1243" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1243</sup></a> that
      whatever has been touched by us in the Name of God in His actual
      service,<a href="#fn1244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1244" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1244</sup></a> should be deemed by you to
      be unclean, which of the Faithful is there who is unaware that
      during the celebration of the Mysteries, the wood of the altar is
      itself covered with linen <a href="#fn1245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1245" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1245</sup></a>? During the
      sacred rites themselves,<a href="#fn1246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1246</sup></a> the covering
      can be touched, not the wood. Or, if the veils can be penetrated
      by the touch, then so can the wood; and, if the wood can be
      penetrated, then so can the earth. If you scrape the wood, you
      should also dig up the earth which is underneath, you should make
      a deep hole, whilst you are searching after that which you are
      pleased to judge to be purity.<a href="#fn1247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1247</sup></a> But take care lest you go
      down to those below,<a href="#fn1248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1248</sup></a> there to
      find Korah, Dathan and Abiram, the schismatics—your masters. It
      is, then, well known that you have both broken and scraped altars.
      How is it that in this matter your madness seems to have presently
      somewhat cooled down <a href="#fn1249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1249" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1249</sup></a>? For we see
      that afterwards you changed your plan, and that the altars were
      now no longer either broken or scraped by you, but only moved. If
      this was enough, then you yourselves prove that what you did at
      first should by no means have been done.</p>

      <p>But when you broke the very Chalices, which carry the Blood of
      Christ,<a href="#fn1250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1250</sup></a> you committed two horrible
      sins.<a href="#fn1251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1251" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1251</sup></a> For you have melted them

      hands to be burned, with which you were accustomed, before us, to

      ordered the sale to take place everywhere. Perhaps wanton women
      bought them for their own purposes; Pagans bought them, so that
      from them they might manufacture vessels, in which to burn incense
      to their idols. O shameful wickedness! O unheard-of crime! To take
      away something from God, that you might give it to idols—to steal
      something from Christ, that it might serve for a sacrilege.</p>

      <p>But I perceive that, in this matter, in order to stir up
      undeserved hatred against us, you wish to have recourse to the
      book of the Prophet Haggai, where it has been written:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Those things which have been touched by the defiled have been
      defiled.’ <a href="#fn1256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1256" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1256</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For those who are in anger, it is easy whilst the anger lasts
      to hurl abuse, but whenever an accusation is made, some clear
      proof is necessary.</p>
      <p>Who then amongst us has ever entered the temples of idols? Who
      has watched the sacrilegious sacrifices? Men may be defiled by
      incense,<a href="#fn1257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1257" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1257</sup></a> odours,<a href="#fn1258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1258" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1258</sup></a> sacrileges, sacrifices,
      blood.<a href="#fn1259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1259</sup></a> But in this matter between
      us, who has entered the temple? Who has burnt incense to idols?
      Who has been stained by unclean odours <a href="#fn1260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1260</sup></a>? Who has looked upon the
      blood of an unclean beast, or of a man, poured forth? Whom can you
      prove to have given his advice for the perpetration of any evil
      deed? Prove—if you can—that even one Bishop has been mixed up with
      any wrongdoing. You have your suspicions, about some Primate or
      other, who was at that time reported to have faltered.<a href="#fn1261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1261</sup></a> Suspicion is not a
      sufficient ground for accusation.<a href="#fn1262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1262</sup></a> Who has charged him? Who
      has convicted him? On what occasion was he ever ashamed, or put
      out of countenance? <a href="#fn1263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1263" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1263</sup></a> Keep your
      suspicions to yourselves.<a href="#fn1264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1264" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1264</sup></a></p>
      <p>So, as we have said above, if in this matter anything was done
      with severity,<a href="#fn1265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1265" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1265</sup></a> we have
      shown, when it is looked at in its commencement, that your fathers
      are responsible. Why then do you speak of Catholics, as though
      they were defiled? Is it because we have followed the Will and
      Command of God by loving peace, by communicating with the whole
      world, in union with those who live in the East, where Christ was
      born, where His holy footsteps touched the ground, where His
      adorable Feet have walked, where so many and such great miracles
      were worked by the Son of God Himself, where so many Apostles
      accompanied Him, where is the Sevenfold Church,<a href="#fn1266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1266" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1266</sup></a> on having been cut off from
      which, you do not merely fail to grieve, but in a sort of way
      rejoice? You call us defiled, because we have loved Unity
      well-pleasing to God. Because we have agreed with and hold
      communion with the Corinthians, Galatians, Thessalonians, you call
      us defiled. You call us defiled, because we have not, together
      with you, read corrupt <a href="#fn1267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1267</sup></a> books—deny,
      if you can, that you read books which differ <span>[</span>from
      those of the Church<span>]</span>.<a href="#fn1268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1268</sup></a> How do you venture to read
      the Epistles written to the Corinthians, you who have refused to
      communicate with the Corinthians? To what purpose do you read
      aloud that which was written to Galatians or to Thessalonians,
      with whom you are not in communion? <a href="#fn1269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1269</sup></a></p>
      <p>Since it is certain that all these things are so, understand
      that <em>you</em> have been cut off from the holy Church, and that
      <em>we</em> are not defiled. What ground, therefore, have you for
      thinking that the prophet Haggai can be of any help to you?</p>
      <p>The altars, then, and the sacred vessels, which we have
      mentioned above, were formerly in both your hands and ours. If you
      slander our hands, why at those altars <a href="#fn1270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1270" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1270</sup></a> condemn your own hands as
      well?</p>
      <p>But you say that you have read:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘That, which one, who is defiled, has touched, is defiled.’ <a href="#fn1271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1271" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1271</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Suppose that anyone has been defiled, so that the things which
      he has touched appear to be defiled—let it be granted, if there
      has only been the touch, that the things which the defiled has
      touched, without any invocation of the Name of God, may be
      contaminated—provided that silence has been kept about God. For if
      there be invocation of the Name of God, the invocation itself
      sanctifies even that which appeared to have been defiled. Thus
      when two hundred and fifty censers, which had been carried in the
      hands of sinners, remained cast away (after those sinners were
      swallowed up by the earth), as the Holy priest Aaron hesitated
      what to do about them, he heard the Voice of God, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Take up, O Aaron, these censers, and make plates of them and
      fasten them in the corners of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,
      because, though those who carried them have sinned, nevertheless
      these vessels are holy, for My Name has been invoked with them,
      saith God.’ <a href="#fn1272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1272</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And surely to carry is more than to touch. Therefore it is
      quite clear that a thing can be made holy by the invocation of the
      Name of God, even though it be a sinner who invokes God. For the
      touch cannot have as much efficacy, as has the invocation of God’s
      Name. And do you too, who count on your own sanctity, tell us
      whether the touch makes holy or the invocation. Surely it is the
      invocation not the touch. Otherwise if you rely upon the touch
      alone, touch a board, a stone, a garment—and let us see whether
      (if silence be kept about God) they can be sanctified.</p>

      <p>Now consider what a foolish—what an empty thing it is for you
      to have exercised your will and your sham authority <a href="#fn1273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1273" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1273</sup></a> by making God’s virgins <a href="#fn1274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1274</sup></a> learn to do Penance, so
      that they who had already made their Profession had afterwards by
      your orders to change the signs of their choice upon their
      heads,<a href="#fn1275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1275" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1275</sup></a> and were compelled to cast
      away their veils, and to receive others in their place.<a href="#fn1276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1276" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1276</sup></a> First tell us where there

      <p>So Paul the Apostle, that famous innkeeper,<a href="#fn1278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1278" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1278</sup></a> to whose care was entrusted
      a people wounded with the wounds of their sins, had received two
      pence to lay out—that is, the two Testaments. These he, as it
      were, expended by his teaching, and taught how Christian husbands
      and wives ought to live; but, when he was asked what command he
      would give concerning virgins, he answered that nothing about
      virginity had been commanded. He acknowledged that he had laid out
      the two Testaments, that is the two pence. In a certain way the
      commission was exhausted, but, inasmuch as Christ, who had
      entrusted the wounded man to his keeping, had promised that He
      would repay whatsoever over and above might be expended upon his
      care,<a href="#fn1279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1279" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1279</sup></a> Paul, after having laid out
      the two pence, gives not commandments, but a counsel with regard
      to virginity. He does not stand in the way of those who desire

      <p>These are words of counsel, nor are any precepts joined to
      them, neither as to the kind of wool from which the veil should be
      made, nor with what sort of purple dye it should be stained. For
      virginity cannot be aided with this kind of garment,<a href="#fn1283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1283</sup></a> nor with it are quenched
      the heats of the soul,<a href="#fn1284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1284" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1284</sup></a> which
      sometimes are enkindled by the summer,<a href="#fn1285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1285</sup></a> nor by it is the mind
      relieved, which from time to time is pressed down by the burdens
      of desires. For if it were otherwise, not one veil, but very many,
      would be placed on the virgin’s head, that, whensoever the desires
      of the flesh should trouble <a href="#fn1286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1286" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1286</sup></a> the soul,
      the number of veils might fight against the stings of the mind.<a href="#fn1287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1287</sup></a> The veil was thought of as
      a sign for the head, not as a remedy on behalf of chastity. So a
      garment of this kind may get old, and be gnawed through and worn
      out; and yet virginity, as long as it has suffered no damage, can
      be safe without a veil.</p>
      <p>This kind of life <a href="#fn1288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1288" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1288</sup></a> is a kind of
      spiritual marriage. They had already come to the nuptials of their
      Spouse by their choice and Profession; and had already loosed
      their hair,<a href="#fn1289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1289</sup></a> thus to show that they had
      given up worldly nuptials, and were joined to their spiritual
      Spouse. They had already celebrated heavenly nuptials. For what
      reason have you forced them to loose their hair a second time? For
      what reason is it, I say, that you have exacted of them a second
      Profession? Who is the second spiritual spouse whom they may wed a
      second time? When did He die, to whom they had been wedded, that
      they may marry again? You have laid heads once more bare, which
      had already received the veil. You have stripped them of the marks
      <a href="#fn1290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1290</sup></a> of their Profession, which
      seem to have been introduced, as a protection against abductors or
      suitors.<a href="#fn1291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1291" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1291</sup></a> The veil is a sign of their
      free choice — not an aid to chastity <a href="#fn1292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1292" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1292</sup></a> —lest the suitor should
      either continue to sue for, or the abductor dare to violate, that
      which had already been consecrated to God.</p>
      <p>The veil, accordingly, is a sign, not a sacrament. You have
      then found virgins of this kind, who had already been wedded
      spiritually—these you forced to second nuptials, and ordered once
      more to loose their hair.</p>
      <p>This is not suffered even by those women who enter upon a
      natural marriage.<a href="#fn1293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1293</sup></a> For if it

      befallen her, the great secular festivity is not repeated; she is
      not puffed up to the skies; there is no great assemblage of people
      provided. Therefore, you have not taken away ornaments from their
      heads, but (as we have said above) the proofs of the choice of the
      better part. You have sprinkled the hair, which had been already
      consecrated to God, with unclean ashes.<a href="#fn1295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1295" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1295</sup></a> You even gave orders that

      dragged back to <span>[</span>the world<span>]</span> remained a
      long time in their original dress, after you had removed the
      outward signs, with which they had fortified themselves against
      suitors and abductors. For when men saw that you had removed the
      barrier which formerly stood in their way, instead of suitors they

      <p>Tell us, my brother Parmenian, what injury the place had done

      entreated? Or, that there Christ was praised? Or, that there was
      invoked the Holy Ghost? Or, that there, though you were absent,
      the books of the Prophets and the Holy Gospels were read aloud?
      Or, that there the minds of brethren, who had once been at strife,
      had been brought into harmony? Or, that unity, well pleasing to
      God, had found there a house, wherein to dwell? Point out to us
      what it is that you have found to wash. If it be the footsteps of
      Catholics—we have trodden both street and square <a href="#fn1317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1317" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1317</sup></a> —why do you not cleanse
      them all? <a href="#fn1318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1318" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1318</sup></a> For you and we, in order to

      everything should be purified after us—wash the water also, if you
      can. Or, if, as we have just said, our footsteps seem to you to be
      defiled, it might be enough to wash the earth. Why, then, have you
      thought fit to wash the walls also, on which the footsteps of men
      cannot be placed? We could not tread the walls, but have only been
      able to see them. But if you think that what has been touched even
      by our looks should be washed, why have you left other things

      washed by you! Have you deserved well of God by washing the one?
      In that case you would seem to have committed a sin, for which
      there is no expiation, in not washing the other. As, then, you

      <p>But I say that you resemble the bird-catcher, who, unlike the
      rest, is not content to go, after night has departed, before
      sunrise, to real trees. He carries his tree with him, and makes up
      into a bundle what will be his grove. Out of which, with all kinds
      of devices, he fashions a tree that has neither pith nor roots. On
      this he places false boughs. So that, which had been lately cut
      down, now receives strange leaves in place of those which it had
      lost. Some birds he carries with him shut up in a cage. Upon the
      false branches he places others that have been stuffed to look as
      though they were alive. The living birds are hid in their cages,
      the others are seen, like living birds upon the branches. A double
      fraud is united by the craft of one man.<a href="#fn1338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1338" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1338</sup></a> And to deceive the

      be singing from the throats of the others. Between the appearance
      on the trees and the sound from the cage one crafty mind does its
      work. The birds that were already captured capture those that are

      <h2 class="unnumbered" id="introduction-to-book-vii">Introduction
      to Book VII</h2>
      <p>At first sight there appears to be some question as to the
      genuineness of this Seventh Book. But on examination it becomes
      practically certain that the great bulk of the Book was written by
      St. Optatus several years after he had closed his original work
      with the striking metaphor on bird-catching to be found at the end
      of Book VI. Some slight doubt still remains concerning two
      passages in the first chapter, and one paragraph in the second
      chapter. But these are almost certainly (were it not for the
      opinion of Ziwsa, to which we shall shortly allude, we should
      write quite certainly) spurious. Accordingly—in this following the
      example of Du Pin—we have separated them from the text, and marked
      them A, B, C.<a href="#fn1340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1340" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1340</sup></a></p>
      <p>Du Pin indeed tells us in his Preface to his Edition of
      St. Optatus that until he had examined the MSS. he was inclined to
      reject all the Seventh Book as spurious, in consequence of the
      following considerations:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>(I)  St. Optatus himself gives the argument of his work as a
      whole, and says that he had divided it into six Books.<a href="#fn1341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1341" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1341</sup></a> Moreover, St. Jerome writes
      expressly that St. Optatus wrote six Books against the Donatist
      calumnies.<a href="#fn1342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1342" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1342</sup></a></p>
      <p>(II)  In his First Book St. Optatus terms the sins of Betrayal
      and Schism, <em>duo mala pessima.</em><a href="#fn1343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1343" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1343</sup></a> In certain parts of the
      Seventh Book, on the contrary, all kinds of excuses—some of them
      very far-fetched—are made for the sin of Betrayal, and the writer
      endeavours to tone down its guilt by all the means at his command.
       </p>
      <p>(III) It seemed to Du Pin at first that there was a certain
      difference of style between the Seventh and the first six
      Books.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But on discovering that the Seventh Book was found (without A,
      B, C) in all the manuscripts which he was able to consult, Du Pin
      was led to revise his opinion as to its genuineness.</p>
      <p>The difficulty arising (I) from the fact that St. Optatus has
      himself mentioned his intention of writing six Books vanished upon
      further consideration, for <em>(a)</em> it is certain (as we have
      already stated <a href="#fn1344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1344" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1344</sup></a>) that
      Optatus made additions to his original work in the time of Pope
      Siricius, and further <em>(b)</em> in the opening words of Book
      VII its author himself distinctly states that this Book is an
      afterthought, due to the fact that the Donatists did not profess
      themselves satisfied by that which he had already written. With
      regard to (II) the change of tone concerning the sin of
      Betrayal—which had been Du Pin’s chief difficulty —it is only to
      be found in the passages marked A and B. These Du Pin
      unhesitatingly rejects (whilst, in the end, with no less
      hesitation accepting the rest of the Book) as the work of a
      Donatist interpolator, referring to them in his Index as
      pseudo-Optatus. </p>
      <p>As for (III) the dissimilarity of style, Du Pin remarks that
      this too is only to be observed in A and B. Indeed far from being
      dissimilar in style there is a very remarkable similarity in this
      respect between Book VII, speaking generally, and the other six
      Books; whilst for myself I fully agree with Ziwsa in thinking that
      even A and B are quite Optatian in style. From this point of view
      they seem to me to be clever forgeries—skilful imitations of the
      genuine work of St. Optatus, with which their author was evidently
      familiar.</p>
      <p>The only remaining difficulty arises from the statement of
      St. Jerome to which we have already alluded. But is it not
      possible that St. Jerome was only acquainted with the First
      Edition of St. Optatus? <a href="#fn1345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1345" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1345</sup></a> However this
      may be, Du Pin meets the difficulty by suggesting that when
      St. Jerome wrote, that which we now read as a connected whole, and
      call the Seventh Book of St. Optatus, was principally to be found
      in the shape of Appendices or additions,, not to the completed
      work, but to several of the other Books regarded separately. To
      illustrate this idea, Du Pin points out that the Donatists very
      likely objected that two statements—both of them to be found in
      the First Book—that their Fathers were Betrayers, and that yet
      they were the Brethren of Catholics—were markedly inconsistent and
      even destructive of one another. ‘If our Fathers were Betrayers,’
      we can well imagine that they urged, ‘why do you call us Brethren,
      and why invite us to Communion?’ <a href="#fn1346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1346" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1346</sup></a> To this objection
      St. Optatus made his reply in the first three chapters of the
      Seventh Book.</p>
      <p>All that we read in the two following chapters concerning
      ‘flies about to die’ and about Jamnes and Mambres should be
      referred to the end of the Second, or perhaps rather to the Fourth
      Book, where Donatist calumnies of a similar character are
      refuted.</p>
      <p>The last two chapters (6 and 7) belong to the Third Book, to
      which they are an addition. As this seems to be, in the judgement
      of all, a fact established beyond doubt, I have already printed
      the translation of those chapters in their proper place at the end
      of Book III.  </p>
      <p>I have thought it safer, however, (in this following not only
      Ziwsa but Du Pin himself,) to keep the first five chapters in the
      form of a separate Book, as we find them in the existing
      manuscripts.</p>
      <p>A, B, C, etc., stand in a different position from the rest of
      the Book, not merely from the fact that they are wanting in most
      of the MSS.,<a href="#fn1347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1347" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1347</sup></a> but above all from their
      character. Ziwsa indeed hesitates and thinks that they may perhaps
      be a kind of retractation by St. Optatus of the severe things
      which are to be found in his work, especially in his First Book.
      Everything written by Ziwsa concerning Optatus deserves, and must
      always receive, the most serious and respectful consideration. But
      it is certain that there is no sign whatever in Book VII (apart
      from A and B) of anything that expresses toning down or apology,
      much less retractation, by the author. There is no recognition of
      any contrast between previous and present statements. Ziwsa’s
      theory must therefore remain, what after all he states it to be, a
      bare possibility and unverifiable hypothesis. Moreover, not only
      do A and B contradict the argument concerning the wickedness of
      Betrayal, which has been brought forward again and again in the
      previous Books, but they are also in opposition to the clear
      statement made in the Seventh Book itself at the end of its first
      chapter:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘<em>Tradere peccatum est</em>.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>They seem to me to be in their poverty of thought, lack of
      argumentative force, and general perversity of expression, quite
      unworthy of St. Optatus (as well as contrary to the consistent
      expression of his mind), and to be just what a cunning Donatist,
      if he had the opportunity, would be glad to insert in the work of
      his great adversary—or possibly they may have come from the hand
      of some unscrupulous Catholic, who, in his desire to make the
      reconciliation of the Donatists as easy as possible, allowed
      himself to forget for the moment that no end, however good and
      desirable in itself, can justify the employment of dishonest means
      for its attainment. In any case, whatever their history, we may be
      quite sure that A and B failed of their purpose. They remain
      merely as a somewhat wearisome curiosity.</p>
      <p>Ziwsa, who has no doubt as to the genuineness of the rest of
      Book VII, observes that in many places it is carelessly written,
      and partakes rather of the nature of a rough sketch, or of notes
      not yet worked up, than of a finished composition. But we must not
      press this too far, for, as Du Pin reminds us, St. Optatus in all
      the Books is very unequal in the polish of his work. Still, even
      though we bear this fact in mind, we shall have to admit that, if
      Book VII is really to be considered as a whole (and not a
      collection of chapters to be added to preceding books), the
      conclusion—wherever we place it (whether at the close of Chapter 5
      or of Chapter 7)—is exceedingly abrupt and furnishes the most
      marked contrast in this respect to the highly polished termination
      of Book VI. That this was the end of the work as originally
      written, there can (as we have already stated) be no doubt.</p>
      <p>With regard then to Book VII, problems exist with reference to
      its exact purpose and original arrangement which will never admit
      of certain and definite solution, but that (apart from A and B) it
      is the work of St. Optatus is no longer questioned by any critic.
      The MSS. evidence is too clear, and the similarity of thought and
      expression too striking, for doubt to be possible. For example,
      who that has ever read the undoubted</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Igitur negare non potes scire te in urbe Roma Petro primo
      Cathedram episcopalem esse conlatam,’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>of ii, 2, can hesitate as to the</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Cathedram Petri . . . poteris adprobare mendacium?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>of vii, 5? This <em>question</em> of the Seventh Book is simply
      the echo of the statement of the First Book. <em>Non potes negare
      = poteris adprobare?</em> (id est, <em>non poteris adprobare</em>)
      <em>mendacium.</em> We have here St. Optatus’ summing up —his
      final cry of triumphant gladness. No forger could have had the
      first sentence of St. Optatus so stamped upon his mind, with its
      unmistakable ring, as to be able to change its form and yet
      reproduce it with such apparent unconsciousness and lack of
      effort, as forgery would here involve. And many similar instances
      might be adduced, which prove that, even independently of the
      weight of MSS. authority, this Seventh Book comes from the same
      brain and personality to which we owe the first six Books of
      St. Optatus against the Donatists.</p>

      <p>Having shown up the Betrayers and having pointed out the holy
      Church—having refuted the calumnies which you were wont to utter
      against us, and having exposed your sins—which have merited to be

      that, though the wood of malice has been cut down by the axes of
      truth, challenges are still sprouting <a href="#fn1350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1350" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1350</sup></a> forth from you or from your
      friends, in which, as I hear, you maintain that, in consequence of
      your being known as the children of Betrayers, you ought not to be
      invited to the communion of unity <a href="#fn1351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1351</sup></a> —to this let me say a few
      words in reply.</p>
      <p>It is most true that the Catholic Church was sufficient for
      herself with her countless peoples in all countries <a href="#fn1352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1352</sup></a>; she was sufficient for
      herself also in Africa, although here she is but in few places.
      But God was not pleased with your separation, for the members of
      one body had been torn asunder, and, against the Will of God, you,
      who are our brothers, wandered away from your brethren. Sentence
      had been passed at home <a href="#fn1353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1353" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1353</sup></a> upon your
      fathers, that they who ought to have been expelled in consequence
      of their confession of Betrayal, should go forth of their own
      accord. No <span>[</span>formal<span>]</span> judgement was
      pronounced,<a href="#fn1354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1354</sup></a> yet the effect of the
      sentence was obtained. They should have been cast off after the
      Betrayal, to which they owned in the Council in Numidia. But, not
      to give an opportunity for the display of their malice,<a href="#fn1355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1355</sup></a> the severity of judgement
      was refrained from, and your ancestors of their own accord made
      their plans, in consequence of their guilt, to cover up their
      crime and depart with the appearance of pride—when they should
      have grieved and blushed for shame. For if at that time they had
      thought it right, for the sake of Peace, to enter into unity,<a href="#fn1356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1356" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1356</sup></a> <span id="A_place" data-label="A_place"></span>{Passage A is found here in the
      manuscripts} and had come to the Catholic Church of their own
      accord—unlike you, who are known to have been drawn <a href="#fn1357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1357" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1357</sup></a> by the Will of God <a href="#fn1358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1358</sup></a> to return whence you had
      wandered (though you are wandering still)—if, as I have said, they
      had come of their own accord to the Catholic Church, perhaps our
      fathers would have hesitated about receiving them, because they
      had been Betrayers; but we have cause for rejoicing, that none
      guilty of Betrayal have lived down to our times.</p>
      <p>So to-day we find quite a new state of affairs, since we have
      to deal, not with them, but with you. Although it appears that a
      stain has passed from them to you by inheritance, nevertheless you
      cannot on this ground be held guilty together with your fathers,
      according to the Judgement of God, who has spoken by Ezekiel the
      prophet, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The soul of the father is Mine, and Mine is the soul of the
      son. The soul that sinneth, shall be punished alone.’ <a href="#fn1359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1359</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And this was proved even in ancient times—at the very beginning
      of the world,<a href="#fn1360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1360" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1360</sup></a> in that his father’s sin
      did not belong to Seth, the son of Adam.<a href="#fn1361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1361</sup></a> And that no one might say
      that in another place it was written by the Lord that He would</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘punish the sins of the fathers even unto the fourth
      generation’ <a href="#fn1362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1362" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1362</sup></a> —</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>—these are undoubtedly both words <a href="#fn1363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1363" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1363</sup></a> of God, but both do not
      refer to one people. The first was said through Moses to a
      definite set of men, the second through Ezekiel to a different
      class. God, since He knew that the Jews would declare to Pontius
      Pilate:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘His Blood be upon us, and upon our children,’ <a href="#fn1364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1364" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1364</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>in His foreknowledge saw that what they would say, was, in
      comparison with the greatness of their sin, but little, and
      threatened the Jews themselves, in order that their crime might be
      expiated by adequate <a href="#fn1365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1365" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1365</sup></a> penalties,
      saying that He would punish the offences of the fathers even to
      the fourth generation. So this word <a href="#fn1366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1366" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1366</sup></a> belongs in a particular way
      to the Jews, and to them alone; but the other, in which God has
      deigned to promise not to punish in sons any sins of their
      fathers, nor in fathers any faults perchance committed by their
      sons, belongs to Christians. <a href="#fn1367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1367" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1367</sup></a></p>
      <p><span id="B_place" data-label="B_place"></span>{Passage B is
      found here in the manuscripts}</p>
      <p>Your fathers, who are proved to have done these things in the
      days of Unity, have fallen away from the number of the living,
      leaving you as it were an inherited stain, which God has already
      washed away by His Providence, when He made a distinction (as we
      have said above) between fathers and their sons. Accordingly,
      since Betrayal is a sin, your fathers must see to it, as to what
      answer they may make in the Judgement of God; but <em>your</em>
      sin it cannot be, since you are living in other times.</p>
      <h3 id="that-good-and-evil-will-be-found-in-the-church-of-god-and-must-be-borne-with-to-the-day-of-judgement.">That
      good and evil will be found in the Church of God, and must be
      borne with to the Day of Judgement.</h3>
      <p>So it is that for long past we have desired to receive you into
      our Communion, because it was not you that sinned at that time,
      but your fathers. <a href="#fn1368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1368" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1368</sup></a></p>
      <p><span id="C_place" data-label="C_place"></span>{Passage C is
      found here in the manuscripts}</p>
      <p>Nor ought any man to judge concerning another man, as though he
      were himself wholly without sin, since it has been written in the
      Gospel that Christ says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Judge not, that you be not judged.’ <a href="#fn1369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1369" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1369</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And this above all, because it will not be possible to find one
      who is absolutely holy. For should any such there be, who are
      unable to sin, they are guilty of lying in the Lord’s Prayer, if
      without reason they beg for pardon and say to God the Father:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass
      against us.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the Apostle John both shows the consciences of all men and
      discloses <a href="#fn1370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1370" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1370</sup></a> his own with these
      words:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves and
      the truth is not in us,’ <a href="#fn1371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1371" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1371</sup></a> —</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>a saying the reason of which we have explained more clearly in
      our Fourth Book. But grant that there are some who have been made
      perfect with complete sanctity, it is not lawful for them to be
      without brethren, whom they are taught not to repel by the
      precepts of the Gospel, wherein we find described a field—that is
      the whole world, in which is the Church <a href="#fn1372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1372" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1372</sup></a> and Christ the Sower, who
      gives wholesome precepts.<a href="#fn1373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1373" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1373</sup></a> On the other
      hand there is an evil man—that is the Devil,<a href="#fn1374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1374" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1374</sup></a> who sows cruel <a href="#fn1375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1375" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1375</sup></a> sins not in the light, but
      in the darkness.<a href="#fn1376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1376" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1376</sup></a> Different
      kinds of seeds come to birth <a href="#fn1377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1377" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1377</sup></a> in one field. Similarly, in
      the Church there is not a mass of souls all alike.<a href="#fn1378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1378" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1378</sup></a> The field receives good
      seeds or bad—the seeds are different. But there is One Creator of
      all souls—one Lord of the field. There are Two who sow seeds where
      the tares are born, but the field has one Lord, the Lord God
      Himself. His is the earth; His are the good seeds; His is also the
      rain. Accordingly, we have consented to receive in unity you, who
      have been drawn <a href="#fn1379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1379</sup></a>
      <span>[</span>to the Catholic Church<span>]</span>, for we are not
      free either to separate or to reject even sinners who have been
      born with us in one field <span>[</span>and<span>]</span> have
      received nourishment <a href="#fn1380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1380" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1380</sup></a> from one
      water <a href="#fn1381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1381" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1381</sup></a>—that is from the one
      Baptism; even as the Apostles were not free to separate the tares
      from the wheat (since separation is impossible without
      destruction<a href="#fn1382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1382" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1382</sup></a>), lest, whilst pulling up
      what ought to be pulled up, that which ought not to be, should be,
      trodden down. In like manner Christ has commanded that both His
      own seeds, and those which belong to the other,<a href="#fn1383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1383" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1383</sup></a> should grow in His field
      throughout the entire world, in which there is the One Church.<a href="#fn1384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1384" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1384</sup></a></p>
      <p>After all have ripened <a href="#fn1385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1385" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1385</sup></a> together,
      shall come the Day of Judgement, which is the harvest of souls.
      Then there shall sit the Judge, the Son of God, who recognises
      what is His own and what is the other’s.<a href="#fn1386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1386" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1386</sup></a> His it shall be to choose

      the burning—whom He shall condemn <a href="#fn1388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1388" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1388</sup></a> to torments that know no
      end,<a href="#fn1389" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1389" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1389</sup></a> and upon whom He may bestow
      <a href="#fn1390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1390" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1390</sup></a> the rewards which He has
      promised.</p>
      <p>Let us recognise that we all are men; let no one usurp to
      himself the power of Judgement that belongs to God. For if any
      Bishop were to claim it all for himself,<a href="#fn1391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1391" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1391</sup></a> pray, what will there be
      for Christ to do in Judgement? It should be enough for a man not
      to be guilty of sins of his own, without wishing to be judge of
      the sins of another.</p>
      <p>So it is our declaration <a href="#fn1392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1392" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1392</sup></a>

      <a href="#fn1394" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1394" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1394</sup></a>? But you have shrunk from
      bringing forward the examples to be found in the Gospel, as for
      instance what has been written concerning the person of the most
      blessed Peter, where we may read a description of the way in which
      unity is to be retained or procured.<a href="#fn1395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1395" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1395</sup></a> Without doubt it is evil to
      do anything against a prohibition, but it is worse not to have
      unity when you may. We see that this unity was preferred to
      punishment <a href="#fn1396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1396" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1396</sup></a> by Christ Himself, who
      chose that all His disciples should be in unity rather than punish
      <a href="#fn1397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1397" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1397</sup></a> a sin against Himself. For,
      as He did not wish to be denied, He declared that whosoever should
      deny Him before men him would He deny before His Father,<a href="#fn1398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1398" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1398</sup></a> <span>[</span>but He did
      not declare that He would punish one who should give up any
      Scripture, since it is more serious to deny Him who spoke, than to
      give up the words which He has spoken<span>]</span>.<a href="#fn1399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1399" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1399</sup></a> And though this has been
      thus written, nevertheless, for the sake of unity, blessed Peter
      (for whom it would have been enough if after his denial he had
      obtained pardon only) both deserved to be placed over all the
      Apostles, and alone received the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,
      which he was to communicate to the rest.<a href="#fn1400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1400" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1400</sup></a> So from this example it is
      given us to understand that for the sake of unity sins should be
      buried, since the most blessed Apostle Paul says that charity <a href="#fn1401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1401" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1401</sup></a> can cover a multitude of
      sins:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Bear your burdens together,’ <a href="#fn1402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1402" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1402</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>he says; and in another place:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Charity is high-souled,<a href="#fn1403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1403" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1403</sup></a> charity is
      kind, charity envieth not, charity is not puffed up, charity
      seeketh not the things that are her own.’ <a href="#fn1404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1404" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1404</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And he has said well. For he had seen all these things in the
      other Apostles, who for the sake of unity, through charity, would
      not withdraw from the communion of Peter—of the man, that is to
      say, who had denied Christ.<a href="#fn1405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1405" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1405</sup></a> But if their
      love of innocence had been greater than the gain <a href="#fn1406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1406" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1406</sup></a> of peace and unity, they
      would have said that they ought not to hold communion with Peter,
      who had denied his Master and the Son of God, the Lord. They
      might, as has been said, not have held communion with the most
      blessed Peter; it would have been possible for them to quote
      against him the words of Christ, who had declared that He would
      deny before His Father whosoever should have denied Him before
      men. We ought industriously <a href="#fn1407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1407" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1407</sup></a> to pay
      attention to the inward meaning of this.<a href="#fn1408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1408" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1408</sup></a> Whilst I say a few words
      concerning it, may the blessed Saint Peter himself pardon me,<a href="#fn1409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1409" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1409</sup></a> if I mention that which we
      read and know that he did. I hesitate to say that so great
      holiness as his has sinned, but he himself proved this fact, when
      he grieved bitterly and wept copiously, since he would neither
      have grieved nor wept, had he not committed any offence. Now the
      Head of the Apostles might surely have so governed himself, as to
      have done nothing, on account of which he should grieve. But many
      faults <a href="#fn1410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1410" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1410</sup></a> are seen in this one case
      of his,<a href="#fn1411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1411" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1411</sup></a> for this reason, that it
      might be shown that for the sake of unity all things should be
      reserved for God.<a href="#fn1412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1412" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1412</sup></a> And I know
      not whether in any other man this kind of sin could be of such
      weight, as was clearly the case in blessed Peter. For whoever
      during some persecution perchance denied the Son of God, will be
      seen, when compared with blessed Peter, to have sinned more
      lightly, if he denied Him whom he had not seen, if he denied Him
      whom he had not recognised, if he denied Him to whom he had made
      no promise, if he denied but once. For in blessed Peter this kind
      of sin was broadened out <a href="#fn1413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1413" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1413</sup></a> —in the
      first place, when Christ asked of all, whom did men say that He
      was, one said ‘Elias,’ another said ‘the Prophet’; then we read
      that Christ said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Whom do you say that I am?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and Peter said to Him:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou art the Son of the Living God’ <a href="#fn1414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1414" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1414</sup></a> —</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>on account of which recognition <a href="#fn1415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1415" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1415</sup></a> he deserved to be praised
      by Christ, <span>[</span>because this he had said through the
      prompting <a href="#fn1416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1416" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1416</sup></a> of God the Father <a href="#fn1417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1417" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1417</sup></a> <span>]</span>. Behold,
      when the others did not recognise the Son of God, He was
      recognised by Peter alone.</p>
      <p>In the second place, when Christ said on the eve of His
      Passion:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Behold I am bound, and you all flee,’ <a href="#fn1418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1418" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1418</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>when the others kept silence, he alone promised that he would
      not go back.<a href="#fn1419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1419" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1419</sup></a> Out of His Foreknowledge,
      the Son of God said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘O Peter, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me thrice.’ <a href="#fn1420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1420" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1420</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Something else was added to the weight of his sin—a promise,
      which he would not fulfil. After Christ was brought into the house
      of Caiaphas, out of so great a number no one was questioned—to
      fill up the measure of his transgression — save blessed Peter.
      When questioned, at first he denies; when questioned, he denies a
      second time; thirdly, he said that he knew Christ not at all; and
      the cock crew, not to mark the time by his crowing, but that
      blessed Peter might recognise how he had sinned. At last he
      grieved bitterly and wept copiously.</p>
      <p>Behold (as we have said above), when the others did not
      recognise he alone recognised, when the others made no promises he
      alone promised, when the others did not deny once he alone denied
      and that three times, but yet, for the sake of unity, he was not
      to be separated from the number of the Apostles.<a href="#fn1421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1421" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1421</sup></a> From which we understand
      that all things were ordered by the Providence of the Saviour,
      that Peter should receive the Keys. The way of malice was stopped
      up, that the Apostles might not conceive in their minds that they
      were free to judge, and condemn with severity, him who had denied
      Christ. So many guiltless ones are standing upright,<a href="#fn1422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1422" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1422</sup></a> and the sinner receives the
      Keys, that the work of unity <a href="#fn1423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1423" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1423</sup></a> might receive its
      pattern.<a href="#fn1424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1424" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1424</sup></a> It was provided that the
      sinner should open for the guiltless,<a href="#fn1425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1425" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1425</sup></a> lest the guiltless might
      close <span>[</span>the gates<span>]</span> against sinners, and

      <p>Now some of your party in their desire to point us out to their
      people as worthy of contempt, mix up in their discourses that
      which was said by the Prophet Solomon concerning ‘the flies that
      are soon to die’:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Flies that are soon to die banish the sweetness of oil,’ <a href="#fn1429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1429" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1429</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and call us ‘flies that are soon to die.’ That liquid <a href="#fn1430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1430" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1430</sup></a> which is seasoned by <a href="#fn1431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1431</sup></a> the Name of Christ, and,
      after it has been seasoned is called Chrism, they call ‘Oil.’ <a href="#fn1432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1432" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1432</sup></a> Before consecration <a href="#fn1433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1433" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1433</sup></a> it is still by nature
      simple oil; it becomes sweet, when it is seasoned from <a href="#fn1434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1434" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1434</sup></a> the Name of Christ.</p>
      <p>There are then three things, of which the Prophet Solomon has
      made mention—<em>the oil, the sweetness</em> and <em>the flies
      that are soon to die</em> which destroy <em>the sweetness.</em>
      These three things have their places in due order. In the first
      place is the oil, in the second is the sweetness that has been
      produced,<a href="#fn1435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1435" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1435</sup></a> in the third the dying
      flies which banish the sweetness. Let then whoever amongst you
      brings forward such an argument <a href="#fn1436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1436" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1436</sup></a> prove why he calls us
      ‘flies that are soon to die.’ You think that you have the power of
      consecration <a href="#fn1437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1437" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1437</sup></a> which gives its sweetness
      to the oil—you have then both the oil and its sweetness. Do we
      ‘banish’ your oil,<a href="#fn1438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1438" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1438</sup></a> so that you
      may with reason <a href="#fn1439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1439" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1439</sup></a> call us
      ‘flies which are soon to die’? That which is yours remains with
      you. And if anyone passes over from you to us, he is left by us,
      as he was sent away by you.<a href="#fn1440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1440" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1440</sup></a> So how can
      you say that we are ‘flies soon to die, which corrupt the
      sweetness of the oil,’ when, <span>[</span>coming<span>]</span>
      after you, we do no such deed? <a href="#fn1441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1441" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1441</sup></a></p>
      <p>Again if you say that the sweetness of the oil can be corrupted
      by us, either we can effect something, and give sweetness to the
      oil, or if, as you maintain, we are not able to effect anything,
      then the oil still remains such as it was by nature.<a href="#fn1442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1442" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1442</sup></a> How then do you say that we
      are ‘flies soon to die, which corrupt the sweetness of the
      oil’?</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the oil, before it is consecrated by us, is such
      as it was by nature.<a href="#fn1443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1443" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1443</sup></a> After it has
      been consecrated,<a href="#fn1444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1444" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1444</sup></a> it is able
      to receive sweetness from the Name of Christ. How can we by the
      same action both consecrate and corrupt? <a href="#fn1445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1445" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1445</sup></a></p>
      <p>It follows that, if the oil be sweet of its own nature, there
      is nothing more left for men to effect, when it is consecrated in
      the Name of Christ.</p>
      <p>The same workman cannot at the same time make two things which
      are repugnant and opposite to each other.</p>
      <p>When we, in your absence, consecrate, we do not corrupt. But if
      we do corrupt, who had before us consecrated anything for us to
      corrupt? Wherefore —that the saying of the Prophet (if it be such)
      may not remain without application—understand that <em>you</em>
      are <em>the flies that are soon to die.</em> For you have banished
      what it had not by nature, but by consecration, since we read that
      what is sweet is not capable of corruption by nature,<a href="#fn1446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1446" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1446</sup></a> for oil is simple and has
      its own one and distinctive name. Once it has been consecrated it
      is called Chrism, in which there is the sweetness which, having
      shut out <a href="#fn1447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1447" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1447</sup></a> the hardness of sins,
      softens the outward skin of the conscience,<a href="#fn1448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1448" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1448</sup></a> which renews a gentle mind,
      which prepares a habitation for the Holy Spirit, so that He may be
      hither invited and, after bitterness has been put to flight, may
      deign here gladly to dwell. This <a href="#fn1449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1449" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1449</sup></a> is the sweetness of the oil
      which flies that are soon to die are able to corrupt. If we were
      to banish the oil which you had consecrated, with reason might you
      call us flies that are soon to die, but so long as we preserve
      that which you have anointed even as we find it, we cannot be
      flies that are soon to die; but whilst you, driven by the storms
      of jealousy, falling, as it were, <span>[</span>like
      flies<span>]</span> into the oil, banish (by rebaptising) the
      sweetness of that oil, which has been consecrated in the Name of
      Christ—from which good morals should be seasoned,<a href="#fn1450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1450" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1450</sup></a> and the light of the mind
      be enkindled to a health-giving <a href="#fn1451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1451" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1451</sup></a> and true understanding—you
      are banishing the reality in which was the oil and sweetness.<a href="#fn1452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1452" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1452</sup></a></p>
      <p>But how have we been able to corrupt a sweetness, which no man
      before us produced by consecration? You have led men astray. You
      have rebaptised. You have anointed a second time.<a href="#fn1453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1453" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1453</sup></a> Oh for shame! To your own
      destruction have you—like flies, which destroy even whilst they
      are dying—banished that which had been consecrated in the Name of
      Christ. Now, sin which has no pardon is death. It has been written
      that:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘he who shall have sinned against the Holy Ghost, it shall not
      be forgiven unto him, either in this world or in the world to
      come.’ <a href="#fn1454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1454" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1454</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Wherefore, inasmuch as you untruly call us <em>flies,</em> and
      hasten to annul <a href="#fn1455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1455" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1455</sup></a> all that we
      have done, and say that we ought to be rejected or despised,
      claiming sanctity for yourselves alone, you put forward your
      innocence, as the ground for promising that you can forgive the
      sins of others. You see therefore that it was not of us, as you
      argue, but of yourselves that the most blessed Apostle Paul has
      said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘There shall be men, lovers of themselves, covetous, praising
      themselves, proud, blasphemers, not obeying parents, ungrateful,
      wicked; not guarding peace, without affection, detractors, not
      gentle, without kindness, <a href="#fn1456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1456" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1456</sup></a> and the
      rest.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="that-the-donatists-and-not-the-catholics-resembled-jamnes-and-mambres.">That
      the Donatists and not the Catholics resembled Jamnes and
      Mambres.</h3>
      <p>Now, to turn to the fact that you have thought fit to take upon
      yourself the character of Moses, who, as the Apostle Paul tells
      us, was opposed by Jamnes and Mambres <a href="#fn1457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1457" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1457</sup></a> —if this be so, what is the
      truth, that may be found with you, which the Catholic Church
      opposes?</p>
      <p>Or, what is there with us which you can prove to be a lie? Is
      it that we are in one communion with the whole world? Will you be
      able to prove that this is a lie? Is it that we keep and defend
      the true and one Creed? Will you be able to prove that this is a
      lie? Will you be able to prove that the Chair of Peter is a
      lie—and the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, which were granted him
      by Christ, with which we are in communion? <a href="#fn1458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1458" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1458</sup></a></p>
      <p>In the very passage of Scripture which you have mentioned,
      consider the order of the actions of the persons themselves, and
      pay attention as to which was the first. Yes, surely, Jamnes and
      Mambres who by their false artifices strove to fight against Moses
      and the truth, are in the second place. Moses, whose miracles they
      attempted in vain to impugn, was before them.<a href="#fn1459" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1459" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1459</sup></a></p>

      level with thy colleagues? For there are some of your party, who,

      things which belong of right to those men who, having already
      fallen away from the Catholic Church,<a href="#fn1464" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1464" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1464</sup></a> consecrated Majorinus—that
      is to say to the authors of Schism and Betrayal. Because they
      still preserved Peace, before they banished unity,—well-pleasing
      to God—they were the light of the world, and with reason were they
      termed the salt of the earth. So long as they taught Peace, they
      were still called the sons of Peace. Before they were puffed up,
      they were blessed in their poverty of spirit, and were part of the
      savour. Whilst they were meek, they were blessed—they were part of
      the savour. Whilst they were just, they were blessed—they were
      part of the savour. Whilst they were sons of Peace, they were
      blessed—they were the whole of the savour. After they bestowed the
      riches of error upon their breath and lungs <a href="#fn1465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1465" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1465</sup></a> and made the schism, they
      were seen to be cruel and without mercy; whilst they impiously
      tore asunder the members of the Church following after wickedness,
      they held the Kingdom of God in contempt, and, dividing the
      Church, were unwilling to be in Peace, they became salt that has
      been spoiled,<a href="#fn1466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1466" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1466</sup></a> from which nothing could be
      seasoned to please God with its sweetness.<a href="#fn1467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1467" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1467</sup></a> And since your first
      leaders were thus wicked, some of your colleagues argue in a
      wrong-headed way,<a href="#fn1468" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1468" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1468</sup></a> so that they
      say that those were foolish, who, quitting the Schism, having,
      however late, recognised the truth and their Mother the Catholic
      Church, followed after Peace. Some of your party think that these

      their savour,<a href="#fn1469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1469" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1469</sup></a> they departed from wisdom.
      From which it is clear that you all make the same mistake in your
      application of names. For you have compared both Jamnes and
      Mambres to peace-loving Catholics, and yourselves, who are
      schismatics, you have compared to Moses—something very far removed
      from the truth. And some of your foolish colleagues have thought
      well to pass judgement on the wise, so as to say that the lovers
      of Peace have become fools and have refused to understand that
      their own fathers have, through their dissension, lose their
      savour <a href="#fn1470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1470" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1470</sup></a>. <a href="#fn1471" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1471" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1471</sup></a></p>

      <p>If at that time they had thought it right, for the sake of
      Peace, to enter into unity, even they would not have been repelled
      by the Church, since in their case dire straits <a href="#fn1472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1472" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1472</sup></a> made excuse for the will.
      For not any of them had been voluntarily Betrayers; otherwise,
      this sin of theirs might have been likened to other
      transgressions.</p>
      <p>Whatever God has willed not to be done, He has forbidden by His
      Mouth—even as He has said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery,’ <a href="#fn1473" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1473" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1473</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and the rest. He might have also forbidden what was done by
      your fathers. But since that which the mind does is one thing,
      whereas that which circumstances bring about is quite another,
      whatever is within the power of man to effect is fit matter for
      prohibition, but whatever evil deeds are brought about through
      necessity may not be blamed with much violence. Therefore wilful
      sins receive punishment, those done through necessity receive
      pardon.</p>
      <p>The murderer, who is not compelled to his crime by any man, is
      free to do the deed; he is also free to leave it undone; the
      adulterer, who is compelled by no one from outside, can commit
      adultery or not, as he chooses. Similarly with other matters of
      like nature, where free choice exists.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, when those things are done, which have been
      forbidden, they are destined for judgement; when things which have
      not been forbidden are done through some sort of necessity,
      perchance He who was unwilling to forbid them, may deign easily to
      pardon. So with regard to this crime <a href="#fn1474" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1474" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1474</sup></a> which might have been
      brought against your fathers as a deadly <a href="#fn1475" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1475" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1475</sup></a> offence—if at that time
      they had been exposed, or brought to judgement concerning it, they
      might have come to their own rescue by alleging more than one
      example. For we read that in the first times <a href="#fn1476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1476" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1476</sup></a> the Tables of the Law were
      broken,<a href="#fn1477" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1477" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1477</sup></a> also that Books were given
      up or cut and burned,<a href="#fn1478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1478" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1478</sup></a> but that no
      one was condemned.</p>
      <p>If (as I have just said) your fathers’ deeds had then been laid
      bare—if they could have been brought to judgement—without doubt
      they might have pleaded that they had done no more than was done
      by Moses the Lawgiver. Although necessity and free will have no
      resemblance, but are contrary to one another,
      <span>[</span>yet<span>]</span> since (so far as the legal name is
      concerned) there was the same case for your fathers as for Moses,
      your fathers might have said <a href="#fn1479" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1479" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1479</sup></a> that they, through
      necessity, did what Moses had of his free will done first. In his
      indignation with the people, he did not consider that God had
      written with His own finger—and what has been written in heaven is
      more than what has been written on earth—nor did he reflect that
      what the Finger of God has written is not the same <a href="#fn1480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1480" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1480</sup></a> as that which has been
      written with a pen made by the hand of a man. Moses carried what
      he had received in the Cloud, and your fathers gave up what they
      had made for payment. With reason, then, might your fathers have
      defended themselves, arguing that it was not a deadly <a href="#fn1481" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1481" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1481</sup></a> offence, if anyone of them
      had done, when terrified by an excessive fear, what Moses had done
      through anger. Neither do we read that the Lord was wroth with
      Moses, nor that He avenged those broken Tables which He had
      written with His own Hand, nor that Moses was termed a sinner or
      punished. The Law came from God in the same way that water comes
      from a fountain, or that fruit <a href="#fn1482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1482" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1482</sup></a> is cut from a tree without
      injury to its root. That which has been used <a href="#fn1483" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1483" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1483</sup></a> is not lost, provided that
      it is safely preserved in its source.<a href="#fn1484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1484" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1484</sup></a> Similarly, Moses was not
      condemned after he had scattered and broken to pieces <a href="#fn1485" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1485" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1485</sup></a> the Tables of the Law. And
      subsequently he was called back, went up Mount Sinai,<a href="#fn1486" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1486" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1486</sup></a> was permitted to speak with
      God, and received a second time the Law now renewed, as has been
      disclosed by the title of the book, which in Greek is called
      Deuteronomy.<a href="#fn1487" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1487" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1487</sup></a> You see that in the Law
      that which had been preserved safe in its Source was not lost. But
      lest anyone should suppose that Moses had merit in a certain
      boldness with God due to his converse with Him, and that it was
      for this cause that God was not displeased with him, and that,
      this being so, it was fitting for friendship always to demand and
      receive its reward and fruit—why then was he afterwards punished
      for another offence? Was it not to show that what he had done in
      his wrath was a venial <a href="#fn1488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1488" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1488</sup></a> offence? The
      Law was safe in God,<a href="#fn1489" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1489" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1489</sup></a> even after
      it, together with the Tables of Stone, had been broken by man;
      whereas <span>[</span>on the other occasion<span>]</span> through
      not rendering that reverence which was due from man, Moses
      deserved the penalty of dying in the midst of his journey, so that
      he entered not into the Land of Promise <a href="#fn1490" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1490" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1490</sup></a>—from which it is clear that
      something, which, as in the present example,<a href="#fn1491" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1491" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1491</sup></a> could escape without
      punishment,<a href="#fn1492" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1492" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1492</sup></a> cannot be looked upon as a
      very great sin.</p>
      <p>If this had been pleaded by your fathers, who could have
      refused them communion? And again, if they had put forward
      instances, which followed afterwards, in which we read of what
      happened when the renewed <a href="#fn1493" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1493" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1493</sup></a> Law was kept
      in the Ark, and the people of Israel were conquered in battle. The
      Law, which by the advice of the people <a href="#fn1494" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1494" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1494</sup></a> was borne in the Ark
      against the enemy, could not be guarded by the priests themselves
      and by the rest of the children of Israel, but far from being
      carried away <span>[</span>in safety<span>]</span> was given up <a href="#fn1495" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1495" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1495</sup></a> to the enemy.<a href="#fn1496" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1496" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1496</sup></a> When the Law had been given
      up,<a href="#fn1497" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1497" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1497</sup></a> those who had urged its
      being brought forward fled away in panic, and we do not read that
      they suffered any punishment in consequence. If this example had
      been alleged <a href="#fn1498" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1498" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1498</sup></a> by your fathers, who would
      have been able to repel them from his communion? Again, (what
      would have happened) if your leaders had not kept silence
      concerning those cases in which we read that Baruch gave up to
      Judin the Scribe the book of the Law which he had received from
      the lips of Jeremiah the Prophet, and that the king’s chief men
      commanded both Baruch himself, who had received the book, and
      Jeremiah, through whom God had spoken, to escape and lie hid?
      Jeremiah dictated, Baruch surrendered—both fled. The book was
      brought to Joachim the king. Now the king, in consequence of the
      coldness of the season, had a brazier <a href="#fn1499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1499" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1499</sup></a> burning before him—so, as
      he was not pleased to hear the book recited by Judin the Scribe,
      he at once tore it up into small fragments <a href="#fn1500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1500" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1500</sup></a> and consigned it to the
      flames. And God was wroth neither with Jeremiah who fled, nor with
      Baruch who fled with him and surrendered the book. For if God had
      been wroth with them, He would have spoken to some other Prophet.
      He did not speak to any other, but to Jeremiah himself, for thus
      do we read:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The Word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after the King burned
      the chapter of the book <a href="#fn1501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1501" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1501</sup></a> and the
      words, which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah. God said to
      Jeremiah: ’’ Take to thyself another paper and write all thy
      words, which were formerly written in the book, that was burned by
      Joachim, king of Judah.”’ <a href="#fn1502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1502" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1502</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So we see that neither was God wroth, nor did the book which
      had been burned perish, nor was Baruch punished, nor was Jeremiah
      disowned by God.<a href="#fn1503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1503" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1503</sup></a> From this it
      is clear that something, which no punishment ever followed, was at
      no time a serious fault.<a href="#fn1504" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1504" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1504</sup></a> If your
      fathers had alleged these examples, who could have rejected them
      from communion? So when God saw that the Tables of the Law had
      been broken by Moses, and that the Ark had been abandoned to its
      foes, and that the book of the Law, after it had been given up by
      Baruch, was both cut up and burned, He showed His Providence and
      promised that He would write the Law henceforward neither on
      Tables nor in Books, but in the very inward parts of man <a href="#fn1505" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1505" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1505</sup></a> —that is, on the mind and
      heart of each believer, even as He had written it in the heart of
      Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the other Patriarchs, who,
      without the Law, certainly lived according to the Law.<a href="#fn1506" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1506" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1506</sup></a> This is proved by the
      blessed Apostle Paul, when he says:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the Living God, not
      on Tables of Stone, but on the fleshy tablets of the heart.’ <a href="#fn1507" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1507" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1507</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>After the Law had been broken by Moses, and abandoned by the
      children of Israel to their enemies, and torn up and burned (when
      offered by Baruch to Joachim the king)—before the Christian times
      in which later on God would write in a better way—God pointed out
      a law through the Prophet, when He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘For this is My Covenant, which I will provide for the house of
      Israel and for the house of Judah, and after those days, saith the
      Lord, I will give My Laws and will write them in their heart and
      in their minds.’ <a href="#fn1508" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1508" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1508</sup></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This He promised long ago and has last of all fulfilled in
      Christian times. Therefore the Book is now in the second place; in
      the second place are the parchments.<a href="#fn1509" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1509" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1509</sup></a> If God wrote the Law there,
      where it could not be betrayed —so that your fathers, who had
      already believed in the Trinity, although they gave up the books,
      gave up neither their own hearts nor minds, in which God,
      according to His Promise, had already written His Law—on what
      ground, my brother Parmenian, have you said that the Law was
      completely burned by the Betrayers? Behold, neither has it been
      completely burned, nor has it been wholly taken away, so long as
      it both remains in the hearts of the Faithful, and thousands of
      books are everywhere read aloud.<a href="#fn1510" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1510" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1510</sup></a> From these considerations
      it is evident that you have, though in ignorance, taken on you to
      accuse your fathers in vain. If, therefore, it would have been
      impossible to repel even your fathers from communion, had they at
      the time of Unity brought forward so many examples which might
      have been reasonably alleged, how much more impossible is it to
      reject you, who are certainly not Betrayers, but the sons of
      Betrayers; since a distinction has to be made between both the
      persons and the names of fathers and sons, and where the sin has
      not been shared, there the same judgement cannot be passed?</p>
      <p>Although if they had been brought into unity,<a href="#fn1511" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1511" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1511</sup></a> and had come to the
      Catholic Church of their own accord .… etc.</p>
      <h3 id="pseudo-optatus-passage-b">Pseudo-Optatus Passage B</h3>
      <p>Nor would he have visited upon the fathers any offences
      perchance committed by the sons. Since, therefore, the Law was
      renewed in the times of Moses without any man being punished, and
      the Ark of the Covenant was freely restored by the enemy, and at
      God’s command a second book was written by Jeremiah,<a href="#fn1512" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1512" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1512</sup></a> why is it thought that your

      something, on account of which, in so many instances, no one was
      condemned?</p>
      <p>For if the Law was given for this purpose, that men should be
      taught, not that the Law itself should be as it were worshipped in
      the place of God, then, after your fathers’ sin, though
      individuals <a href="#fn1514" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1514" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1514</sup></a> lost their volumes <a href="#fn1515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1515" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1515</sup></a> under the pressure of fear,
      yet the mass of the Faithful <a href="#fn1516" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1516" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1516</sup></a> suffered no loss. For the
      Law, which had been necessary, <a href="#fn1517" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1517" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1517</sup></a> still has its force <a href="#fn1518" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1518" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1518</sup></a> amongst the teachers of the
      people and the worshippers of God. The libraries are filled with
      books. Nothing is wanting to the Church. In different places <a href="#fn1519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1519" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1519</sup></a> the divine praises are
      everywhere proclaimed. The mouths of the lectors keep not silence.
      The hands of all are full of volumes <a href="#fn1520" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1520" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1520</sup></a> <span>[</span>of
      Scripture<span>]</span>. Nothing is lacking to the people who wish
      to be taught—although the law would not seem to have been written
      more for the sake of teaching, than for that of the judgement to
      come, in order that the sinner may know what may befall him,
      should he not live rightly. Thus has it been written, and thus do
      we read, that</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘the Law has not been given for the just,’</p>

      <p>And in another place the blessed Apostle Paul also says that

      <p>And in the earliest times the Patriarch Noah did nothing by
      which he might become just, yet he as a just man was chosen to

      waters with success. It were a long task to go through all the

      just.</p>
      <p>If these things had been pleaded by your fathers, who would
      then have rejected them from his communion? Again,
      <span>[</span>what would have happened<span>]</span> if they had
      asserted that what the Apostle says of those who are outside the
      Law <a href="#fn1529" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1529" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1529</sup></a> ought not to be passed over

      <p>For many are known to have sinned with the Law,<a href="#fn1531" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1531" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1531</sup></a> and many to have lived well

      Him. After the Scripture has been given up—so it is said—by your
      fathers, it wants for nothing, all the members of the Law are
      sound—are safe, and are read aloud. There is, for those who desire
      to teach and to be taught, nothing less than there was of the Law.
      Was it then necessary for man to be slain rather than that any
      Scripture should be given up? Again, men have not been slain, yet
      all the Scriptures are here without diminution. The Law and God
      are not one and the same thing. If they had had to die for God,
      who can both raise up the dead and give reward, <span>[</span>well
      and good<span>]</span>; but a book that has not been surrendered
      cannot do even the second of these two things.<a href="#fn1534" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1534" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1534</sup></a></p>
      <p>Therefore, necessity shackles <span>[</span>a
      man’s<span>]</span> own strength of will.<a href="#fn1535" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1535" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1535</sup></a> We often see that
      carelessness is as disastrous as necessity. For if the parchments
      or the books, in which the canonical <a href="#fn1536" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1536" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1536</sup></a> Scripture is contained,
      must be kept totally unimpaired, why are not some careless people
      condemned? There is no wide gulf between giving up <a href="#fn1537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1537" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1537</sup></a> and placing in a bad
      situation, or treating badly. One man has placed the book in a
      house, which has been burned down in a fire. Let him be condemned,
      who carelessly placed the book in that house, if another is to be
      condemned who through fear gave up the book that he knew would be
      demanded of him. Let them also be condemned, who placed neglected
      parchments, or books, where they might be gnawed by little
      household animals <a href="#fn1538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1538" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1538</sup></a> (that is by
      mice) in such a way that they could not be read. Let him be
      condemned, as well, who has placed them in a part of the house,
      where, in consequence of too great abundance of rain, water has
      dropped through the eaves from the roof, so that all the writing
      has been washed away by the wet, and can no longer be read. Let
      those too be condemned, who have been rash enough to entrust
      themselves, together with the books of the Law, to the hungry
      waves of the sea, and in their eagerness to save their lives, when
      in the water, have let the Scriptures slip from their hands.
      Accordingly if the Scripture be the same <a href="#fn1539" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1539" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1539</sup></a> always, and, if he who has
      not been able to save it, is guilty—then, one has given it up to
      the waves, another has abandoned it to rodents,<a href="#fn1540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1540</sup></a> another has carelessly
      allowed it to be spoiled by the dropping water, and yet another,
      terrified by the fear of death, has, as man, given it to man. If
      all have done the same thing,<a href="#fn1541" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1541" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1541</sup></a> why is one chosen out to be
      condemned—and this, even though the fault of the Betrayer is
      lighter than is that of him who has been careless? He who placed
      it in the way of mice, or left it under the dropping water, with
      his will was careless, whilst he who lost it in the river, sinned
      through rashness. He who through the fear of death gave anything
      up, gave it as a man to a man. It was whole whilst with the giver,
      it remained whole in the hands of the receiver. If he who received
      it, gave it up to the flames, this is the sin of the one who
      burned it, not of him who surrendered it. If these things had been
      urged by your fathers, how could we have rejected them from our
      communion? Or if again they had thought well to refer to the times
      of King Antiochus,<a href="#fn1542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1542" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1542</sup></a> when all the
      Jews were compelled to surrender their Books to be burned, and the
      whole of the Scripture was given up so completely that not a
      letter <a href="#fn1543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1543" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1543</sup></a> remained in any one book?
      Not one of the Jews was then condemned, nor was any sentence
      pronounced against any Jew either by God or by some angel, because
      the sin was his who commanded and threatened, not the people’s who
      surrendered with fearfulness and sorrow. And in order that this
      Antiochus should do no injury to His people in these early days,<a href="#fn1544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1544" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1544</sup></a> God immediately provided
      for one man Esdras,<a href="#fn1545" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1545" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1545</sup></a> who was
      called a Reader at the time, to dictate the whole as it had been
      before, to the minutest point.<a href="#fn1546" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1546" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1546</sup></a> In this way the tyrant

      have received them into his communion without fear,<a href="#fn1550" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1550" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1550</sup></a> since, as has been said,

      <h2 class="unnumbered" id="introduction-to-the-appendix">Introduction to the
      Appendix</h2>
      <p>St. Optatus makes several references to the documents which he
      tells us that he was appending to his work, in order fully to
      establish the accuracy of his statements. For example, with regard
      to the Council at Cirta, which was the beginning of all the evil
      subsequently to be known as Donatism, he appeals to the evidence
      afforded by the writings of Nundinarius the Deacon, and to the
      Acts of the Council, which—so he says—</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘dubitantibus proferre poterimus, harum namque plenitudinem
      rerum in novissima parte istorum libellorum ad implendam fidem
      adiunximus’ (i, 14).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the same way he states (i, 20) that he is appending the
      letter, in which the Bishops who were responsible for the
      consecration of Majorinus brought their charges against Caecilian.
      Again, with regard to the decrees of Eunomius and Olimpius he is
      able to write (i, 26):</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘De iis rebus habemus volumina actorum, quod, si quis voluerit,
      in novissimis partibus legat.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These decrees have been lost. But we have still extant (in
      their entirety or in part) most of the documents which were placed
      in his Appendix by St. Optatus.</p>
      <p>The Colbertine MS. (C) has alone preserved for us any part of
      this Appendix. Moreover we possess this MS. in a very incomplete
      state. It commences only with the middle of the Sixth Book, and at
      the end of the Seventh we read:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>’Expliciunt Sancti Optati Episcopi Libri Numero VII vel Gesta
      Purgationis Caeciliani Episcopi et Felicis Ordinatoris Eiusdem.
      necnon Epistola Constantini Imperatoris. <em>Amen.’</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But unfortunately there are many pages wanting between the
      <em>Gesta Purgationis Caeciliani</em> and the <em>Gesta
      Purgationis Felicis</em>—so that Duchesne writes that at least as
      much of the <em>Gesta Purgationis Caeciliani</em> has been lost as
      yet remains, perhaps double or treble or possibly even more.<a href="#fn1553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1553" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1553</sup></a> With regard to the
      <em>Gesta Purgationis Felicis</em> comparatively little is
      missing, though the account of the inquiry before the Pro-Consul
      Aelianus starts somewhere in the middle.<a href="#fn1554" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1554" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1554</sup></a></p>
      <p>Duchesne has carefully reconstructed the Appendix of St.
      Optatus,<a href="#fn1555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1555" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1555</sup></a> and shown that it probably
      contained the following documents:</p>
      <p>I. <em>Acta Purgationis Caeciliani</em></p>
      <p>(1) Gesta apud Zenophilum.</p>
      <p>(2) Acts of Cirta.</p>
      <p>(3) Synodal letter of Donatist Council at Carthage against
      Caecilian (lost).</p>
      <p>(4) Letter of Pro-Consul Anulinus to Constantine.</p>
      <p>(5) Supplication of Donatists (in Optatus i, 22).</p>
      <p>(6) Letter of Constantine to Miltiades.</p>
      <p>(7) Report of Anulinus to Constantine (lost).</p>
      <p>(8) Acts of Roman Council (nearly all lost: a fragment in Opt.
      i, 23, 24).</p>

      <p>(10) Proceedings of Eunomius and Olimpius in Africa (lost).</p>
      <p>II. <em>Acta Purgationis Felicis</em></p>
      <p>(11) Letter of Constantine to Aelius (or Aelianus?) (lost).</p>
      <p>(12) Letter of Constantine to Probianus.</p>

      <p>III <em>Epistola</em><span>[</span><em>e</em><span>]</span>
      <em>Constantini Imperatoris</em></p>
      <p>Probably, however, the collection of Optatus did not contain
      the letter of the Council of Arles (though it is found in C),
      since we find no reference to it in his work.</p>
      <p>Of these documents, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 have been quoted or
      analysed by St. Optatus and St. Augustine; 4 and 12 have been
      reproduced in their entirety, and 9 in part, by St. Augustine
      only; 10 was known to St. Optatus only. All these documents, with
      the exception of 1 and 10, were put in and read at the Conference
      at Carthage in 411.</p>
      <p>I give, in the first place, a translation of everything that we
      still find in C.</p>
      <p>We have part of the two interesting trials—of Felix of Aptunga
      (the consecrator of Caecilian) on the one side and of Silvanus
      (one of the consecrators of Majorinus) on the other. By these
      documents considerable light is thrown upon several details of
      Roman judicial procedure in Africa during the early years of the
      fourth century. There are also six letters of Constantine; a short
      document consisting of a joint letter from officials named
      Petronius and Julianus; and the well-known synodal letter sent by
      the Council of Arles, at the conclusion of its labours, to Pope
      Silvester. These letters have been printed in their chronological
      order. In each case I have thought it well to prefix a short
      introduction.</p>
      <p>With regard to my translation, perhaps I may be permitted to
      crave the indulgence of my readers. The great Emperor’s sentences
      (as at least they appear in his letters) are of extraordinary
      length and complexity, with parenthesis heaped upon parenthesis,
      so that the task of disentangling them in such a way as to make
      their meaning intelligible in English, without the sacrifice
      either of grammar or of verbal accuracy, is one of no small
      difficulty, as anyone who may make the attempt will discover for
      himself.</p>
      <p>Ziwsa is satisfied with printing these ten documents, but I
      have also translated and printed the others of St. Optatus’
      original collection which still remain extant. They are:</p>
      <p>xi.—(<em>a</em>) The Acts of the Council of Cirta (to be found
      nearly complete in Augustine <em>con. Crescon.</em> iii, 30).</p>
      <p>xii.—(<em>b</em>) Letter of Anulinus to Constantine (of which
      the text has been preserved in Augustine <em>Ep.</em> lxxxviii,
      2).</p>
      <p>xiii.—(<em>c</em>) Letter of Constantine to Miltiades (to be
      found in Eusebius, <em>H.E.</em> x, 5).</p>
      <p>xiv.—(<em>d</em>) Letter of Constantine to Probianus (entire in
      Augustine <em>con. Crescon.</em> iii, 81).</p>
      <p>I give also two official letters (xv, xvi) from Constantine to
      the Pro-Consul Anulinus, which have been preserved by Eusebius,
      and throw considerable light on the Emperor’s attitude towards
      Catholics and Donatists respectively at this time (a.d. 313).</p>
      <p>In addition to the documents which Duchesne shows to have been
      contained in the Appendix of Optatus, the following were quoted
      either by St. Augustine or by the Donatists at the Conference of
      Carthage (a.d. 411).</p>
      <p>(1) Acts of seizure of Sacred Books at Rome in 303 (lost).</p>
      <p>(2) Acts of Donatist Martyrs of Abilina (Migne, <em>P.L.</em>
      viii, 689-703).</p>
      <p>(3) Letters of Mensurius and Secundus (lost).</p>
      <p>(4) Procès-verbal of the restitution of the Holy Places in Rome
      to Pope Miltiades by order of the Emperor Maxentius (lost).</p>
      <p>(5) The two letters of Constantine preserved by Eusebius (x, 5,
      7), which I have printed and numbered xv, xvi.</p>
      <p>(6) Three letters of Constantine (lost).</p>
      <p>(7) Supplication to Constantine by Donatists, complaining of
      persecution (lost).</p>
      <p>(8) Letter of Constantine to Verinus, May 5, 321 (lost).</p>
      <h3 id="acta-purgationis-felicis-episcopi-autumnitani">Acta
      Purgationis Felicis Episcopi Autumnitani</h3>
      <p>The scene of the events described in this document—of which
      unfortunately a large part is missing—was Carthage. The date is
      a.d. 314. It is, therefore, exactly sixteen hundred years since
      Constantine, fresh from his victory over Maxentius and full of
      zeal for the welfare of the religion which he had so recently
      embraced, gave orders for the charge of Betrayal brought so
      persistently against Felix, Bishop of Aptunga, to be heard
      publicly on the spot—that is to say in Africa. It was indeed
      notorious that there was no real ground for this charge. But to
      the Donatists it was a matter of life and death that the truth of
      their accusation against the consecrator of Caecilian should be
      substantiated, or at any rate generally accepted. Otherwise any
      attempt to justify their schism broke down of itself. When the
      matter was gone into at Rome under Pope Miltiades, it had been
      admitted that no accusation was made against Caecilian
      personally.<a href="#fn1556" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1556" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1556</sup></a> The whole question really
      concerned Felix. Consequently Caecilian was declared at Rome to be
      the rightful Bishop of Carthage, and the legates Eunomius and
      Olimpius promulgated the Roman decree at Carthage itself. Still
      the Donatists remained obstinate, and represented to Constantine
      that their case had not been fairly heard, but that the judges had
      shut themselves up and given their verdict without any regard to
      the weight of evidence.<a href="#fn1557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1557" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1557</sup></a> Thus it came
      to pass that a certain Alfius Caecilianus <a href="#fn1558" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1558</sup></a> was ordered to go before
      the Proconsul’s court at Carthage, there to give an account of a
      former investigation of this same matter which had been held at
      the time when he was himself <em>duovir.</em> He was told to bring
      with him the men who had been his secretary and notary
      respectively. The name of the Proconsul before whom the trial was
      to be heard was Aelianus. With Aelianus were at least three
      commissioners or assessors (though their name of <em>duovirs</em>
      seems to us somewhat quaintly out of keeping with this fact),
      Gallienus, Fuscius and Sisenna.</p>
      <p>The case heard at Rome had direct reference to Caecilian. Now,
      the case of Felix was to be examined anew, without any reference
      to Caecilian, on its own merits.<a href="#fn1559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1559" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1559</sup></a> We shall see that Aelianus
      required the Acts of the former African trial to be produced and
      read <em>in extenso.</em> Alfius Caecilianus, in consequence of
      his age, had been excused from going to the Imperial Court and had
      made a deposition before the <em>duovir</em> Aurelius Didymus
      Speretius. It was shown that the letter upon which the Donatists
      relied to convict Felix had been interpolated (or rather added to)
      by a certain Ingentius. This Ingentius was secretary to one
      Augentius, who had been fellow-aedile with Caecilianus. After
      these Acts had been read the counsel Apronianus insisted on
      questioning Caecilianus, who explained in some detail his dealings
      with Ingentius.</p>
      <p>Ingentius had falsely represented that Felix had told him that
      he had certain valuable codices in his possession—and that their
      owner now wanted them back—so would Ingentius obtain a letter from
      Caecilianus stating that they had been burned when he was
      <em>duovir</em>? Thus Felix would be able to steal the codices!
      Had Caecilianus given the letter, as requested, it was to have
      been used as a proof that Felix had been a Betrayer. It was an
      ingenious plot; but it failed. At first Caecilianus would not
      write anything. In the end Ingentius induced Augentius to persuade
      Caecilianus to write a letter of some kind. This letter has been
      almost wholly lost, but it is clear that from the point of view of
      Ingentius it was quite unsatisfactory, as it contained nothing
      which would have been of any value for his purpose. So Ingentius
      forged the interpolation, which had been read out at the previous
      trial. Caecilianus swore that this interpolation was a forgery,
      and indeed it could not possibly be genuine, since it consisted of
      an addition (after the original conclusion) purporting to relate a
      conversation with Felix, who was absent from home at the time. It
      represents him as giving up the Scriptures <em>privately</em> to a
      friendly official. This was meant to explain why there was no
      public proof available of Felix’s fall.</p>
      <p>The evidence was all against Ingentius, who had to confess to
      the forgery, under fear of torture. But he tried to make out that
      he committed his crime through love for a certain Bishop Maurus,
      who was charged with simony. It was shown, however, that,
      notwithstanding his oaths to the contrary, he had been an envoy of
      the Donatist faction throughout Numidia and Mauritania, so that it
      became clear that the calumny had been invented in the interests
      of party.</p>
      <p>Thus was Felix finally and triumphantly vindicated.</p>
      <p>The Donatists, who styled themselves ‘the Pure,’ were conscious
      of being themselves <em>Traditores</em>. It was partly in order to
      cover up their own guilt that they invented the quite baseless
      charge against Felix, the consecrator of Caecilian Bishop of
      Carthage.<a href="#fn1560" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1560" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1560</sup></a> That charge once
      formulated, the next step was to argue that all who communicated
      with Caecilian—‘polluted’ by Betrayal—were themselves ‘polluted,’
      even though this conclusion might involve the whole Catholic world
      in apostasy from Christ. All this has been made clear in the pages
      of St. Optatus.</p>
      <p>The document now before us has vivid touches of dramatic
      interest, where various scenes are described, as they took place,
      with much actuality. Sometimes, it must be admitted, we cannot
      well refrain from asking ourselves how far, with regard to
      details, play is being given to the exercise of the imagination.
      But as to the central fact of the innocence of Felix there can be
      no question, nor as to the justice of the verdict which Optatus
      tells us was delivered in his favour.<a href="#fn1561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1561" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1561</sup></a> Whoever else may have

      Carthage. The Curator is present. In his presence we charge you,
      what answer do you make to this?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Caecilianus said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘As soon as you handed to me the letter of the Right Honourable
      Aelius Paulinus, acting deputy of the Prefect, I sent immediately
      to my secretary Miccius to come and bring me the Acts which were
      set down at that time, and he is still searching for them. For no
      small space of time has passed since I held the office of Duovir.
      It was eleven years ago. So, as soon as he has found them, I will
      obey a command of such high dignity.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Gallienus the Duovir said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘It is to your interest to obey the command, for you see that
      it is sacred.<a href="#fn1569" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1569" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1569</sup></a>’</p>

      <p>Caecilianus said:</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Then when, a little time after, the secretary Miccius had also
      arrived, Fuscius the Duovir said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Have you too, Miccius, heard that you also have to go with
      Caecilianus to the office of the Right Honourable Deputy, and
      bring there with you the documents concerning that time? What have
      you to say to this?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Miccius answered:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The magistrate, when his year of office was completed, took
      all his Acts home with him. ... I am searching to see whether the
      wax tablet can be found among them. <a href="#fn1571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1571" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1571</sup></a>’</p>

      knows.’</p>

      <p>Apronianus said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘If the magistrate took away all his Acts, whence can we
      procure the Acts which were then made or put together at a time of
      so great importance?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And, when he said this, Aelianus the Proconsul said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Both my questions and the answers of the various persons are
      contained in the Acts.’</p>

      <p>Agesilaus said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘There are besides other letters, necessary for the
      understanding of this affair. It is of importance that they should
      be read.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Aelianus the Proconsul said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Read them in the hearing of Caecilianus, that he may know
      whether he dictated them.’</p>

      <p>During the consulate of Volusianus and Annianus, on the

      against them in this matter are being searched for. When
      persecution was proclaimed against the Christians, that is to say,
      when they were required to offer sacrifice, or betray whatever
      Scriptures they might have, to be burned, Felix, who was then
      Bishop of Autumna, had given his consent for Scriptures to be
      given up by the hand of Galatius, that they might be committed to
      the fire. And at that time Alfius Caecilianus, whom you may
      observe here present, was a magistrate, and since it was then his
      duty to see that, in accordance with the proconsular command, all
      should sacrifice, and that, in accordance with the Imperial law,<a href="#fn1575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1575" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1575</sup></a> they should hand over any
      Scriptures they might possess, I ask him, since he is here <a href="#fn1576" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1576</sup></a> and you see he is an old
      man and cannot go to the Imperial Court, to make his deposition in

      with an agreement which he had already made, and as to whether the
      statements which he has made in the letter are true—so that the
      actions and the truthfulness of these persons may be set forth in
      the trial before the Emperor.’</p>
      <p>Speretius the Duovir said to Caecilianus who was present:</p>
      <p>‘Do you hear what are the depositions in the Acts?’</p>
      <p>Alfius Caecilianus said:</p>
      <p>‘I had gone to Zama with Saturninus to buy linen garments,<a href="#fn1578" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1578" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1578</sup></a> and when we arrived there,
      the Christians themselves sent to me in the praetorium to ask “Has
      the Emperor’s ordinance reached you?” I answered “No, but I have
      already seen copies, and have seen churches destroyed and also
      Scriptures burnt at Zama and Furni. So if you have any Scriptures,
      bring them forth, that the Emperor’s command may be obeyed.” Then
      they sent to the house of the Bishop Felix to bring out the
      Scriptures from there, that they might be burnt in accordance with
      the Emperor’s decree. So Galatius went with us to the place where
      they had been accustomed to celebrate their prayers. We took out
      the Chair and the letters of salutation,<a href="#fn1579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1579" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1579</sup></a> and afterwards <a href="#fn1580" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1580" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1580</sup></a> all were burnt in
      accordance with the Emperor’s decree. And when we sent to the
      house of this Bishop Felix the public officials informed us that
      he was not there. And when, at a later time,<a href="#fn1581" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1581" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1581</sup></a> Ingentius arrived—the

      the stone. But see, I beg you, that the officials do not take away
      the oil and wheat.” <a href="#fn1587" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1587" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1587</sup></a> And I said

      <p>It is A.D. 320, six years after the vindication of Felix of
      Aptunga, and another trial is proceeding. Time has amply brought
      her revenge. Now the accusation is no longer against the
      consecrator of Caecilian the Catholic Bishop of Carthage, but
      against Silvanus the Donatist Bishop of Cirta, the consecrator of
      Majorinus, who had been intruded into Caecilian’s Chair. In this
      trial it is conclusively proved that Silvanus and his abettors had
      been guilty not merely of Betrayal—the sin falsely alleged against
      Felix and Caecilian, as a pretext for abandoning communion with
      Caecilian—but also of theft and simony under peculiarly
      disgraceful circumstances.</p>
      <p>St. Optatus, in his description of the commencement of the
      Donatist schism, has mentioned the name of the Deacon Nundinarius,
      the editor of the Acts of the Bishops who, in the year 303, met at
      Cirta to elect a successor to the recently deceased Bishop of that
      city.<a href="#fn1622" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1622" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1622</sup></a> When the citizens of Cirta
      heard that Silvanus had been chosen to be their chief
      Pastor—Silvanus, a man of bad reputation, who was well known to
      them as a <em>Traditor</em> — they cried out ’<em>Traditor est,
      alius fiat. Purum et integrum civem nostrum volumus.’</em> The
      clergy also protested against this election, but Silvanus was
      supported by a noisy mob of the lowest rabble, and consecrated
      Bishop by the notorious Secundus of Tigisis. One of the first acts
      of Silvanus after his consecration was to ordain a certain Victor.
      This Victor, in order to be made a priest, paid a large sum of
      money to Silvanus, which Silvanus on his part promptly distributed
      amongst Secundus and the other Bishops who had taken part in his
      own consecration. (Such was the character of the shameless men,
      who were so soon, for their own purposes, to precipitate the
      Donatist schism by their consecration of Majorinus in opposition
      to Caecilian.)</p>
      <p>Now these facts were well known to Nundinarius the Deacon. It
      was therefore an evil hour for Silvanus, leading him into much
      trouble, when, for some reason unknown to us, he violently
      quarrelled with Nundinarius. Other guilty Donatist Bishops,
      especially the terrible Purpurius <a href="#fn1623" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1623" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1623</sup></a> and a certain Fortis, were
      greatly alarmed when the news of this quarrel reached their ears,
      and wrote to Silvanus, and to their party in Cirta, that it was
      imperative that a reconciliation should be effected between
      Silvanus and Nundinarius. Means must be found to hush the matter
      up, lest worse things befall them. Evidently it would be too
      deplorable if it were to be publicly proved that they had been
      themselves guilty of crimes far more shameful than anything with
      which they falsely reproached the Catholic Bishops. But it was all
      to no purpose. Nundinarius was, in the end (though he seems to
      have wavered for a while), not to be appeased. Catholics called
      out for a public investigation. It was granted, and followed in
      due course before Zenophilus.</p>
      <p>Throughout the proceedings Nundinarius proved the case against
      Silvanus with merciless precision. There was first the evidence of
      an inhabitant of Cirta—a certain Victor, a grammarian. As this
      Victor tried at first to screen Silvanus, there were read aloud
      municipal Acts recorded during the persecution when Munatius Felix
      was <em>Curator.</em> From these it became clear that Silvanus had
      indeed been a Betrayer, and Victor had to admit this, though he
      tried to save himself by denying that he was present when it all
      happened. Then the compromising and discreditable letters were
      read, from which it was seen how much Purpurius and Fortis dreaded
      exposure. No doubt they were afraid that Nundinarius might
      denounce them, as already he had denounced Silvanus in a
      <em>libellus</em> of accusation, which had been addressed to all
      the clergy and elders of Cirta, and was read in full before
      Zenophilus. Furthermore, witnesses were produced who told the old
      story of the events that took place at the consecration of
      Silvanus, which proved him to have been guilty of Betrayal and
      Simony. It was also shown that he and Purpurius, as well as other
      Donatists, had been guilty of thefts from the Temple of Serapis.
      Further evidence was given which proved that the Numidian Bishops
      (now Donatists) had received money from Lucilla, in order that
      Majorinus might be consecrated rival Bishop of Carthage in
      opposition to Caecilian, and that they had kept it all for
      themselves, though part of it at least was intended by its donor
      for the poor.</p>
      <p>Most of these Proceedings are extant, but the judgement is
      wanting. It is, however, certain that Silvanus was banished by
      Zenophilus for Betrayal,<a href="#fn1624" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1624" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1624</sup></a> for robbing
      the Treasury of vinegar casks, for taking money for Ordination,
      and for having been himself made Bishop by violence, of all of
      which crimes he had been proved guilty in the course of these
      Proceedings.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Surely you either heard or saw it, if it was said to the poor:
      “Lucilla, out of her substance, makes you also a present”?’</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘I did not see anyone get anything.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Zenophilus said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The evidence of Castus is quite clear, that he has no
      knowledge that the money which Lucilla gave was distributed among
      the people. So let him be dismissed.’</p>

      <p>And when Crescentianus the subdeacon was called in and sworn,
      Zenophilus said:</p>

      <p>He answered:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>Zenophilus said:</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>He answered:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Nothing. We too must have received something if the
      distribution had been made in the usual manner.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Zenophilus said to Nundinarius:</p>

      be dismissed.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Then when Januarius the subdeacon was brought in and sworn,
      Zenophilus said:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘What is your name?’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He answered:</p>
      <p>(What followed in the manuscript is lost.)</p>
      <h3 id="constantinus-augustus-aelafio">Constantinus Augustus
      Aelafio</h3>
      <p>In this letter Constantine sends orders to his Vicar in Africa
      that Caecilian and certain other Bishops (both Catholic and
      Donatist) should be directed to proceed, with some of their
      clergy, to Aries, where a Council was to be held (as he explains)
      once more publicly to vindicate the character of Caecilian. The
      date is 314.</p>
      <p>This letter may be compared with another letter sent by
      Constantine to Chrestus, Bishop of Syracuse, and preserved for us
      by Eusebius (x, 5). In both these letters August 1 is fixed as the
      date for the opening of the Council at Arles; in both we find a
      reference to the Council which had been already held at Rome under
      Miltiades. Indeed the similarity between them is so striking that
      it has been suggested that the letter to Aelafius is a forgery and
      has been copied from that to Chrestus. But Mgr. Duchesne has shown
      (<em>op. cit.</em> p. 32) that this is quite impossible, since the
      letter to Chrestus was unknown in Africa, at the time when the
      letter to Aelafius was placed in the collection used by Optatus.
      The only edition of Eusebius known to St. Augustine, for example,
      was the version of Rufinus, where Book Ten (containing the letter
      to Chrestus) is wanting.</p>
      <p>It has also been urged as an argument against the authenticity
      of <em>the Letter to Aelafius</em> that the Bishops are herein
      ordered to adopt a most improbable itinerary. They were directed
      to follow the coast of Mauritania, thence to pass into Spain, and
      then to travel to Arles by land; whereas it has been pointed out
      that it would have been far simpler and cheaper to embark at
      Carthage, or Hippo, and go straight to Marseilles by sea. But here
      again Mgr. Duchesne has observed, with irrefutable force, that if
      <em>the Letter to Aelafius</em> be not genuine, it must have been
      composed by an African of the fourth century. During the course of
      that century there is no reason to suppose that there was any
      change of routes. And (to quote the words of Duchesne):</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘The Africans who were the contemporaries of St. Optatus knew
      how people went from their own country into Gaul. No one of them,
      had he forged such a letter as this, would ever have dreamed of
      placing within it an impossible itinerary.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On the other hand we can nowadays know but little of the
      circumstances which may well have caused the itinerary described
      in this letter to have been chosen for the journey of the Bishops
      to Gaul. So we may safely conclude, with Duchesne, that as to the
      authenticity of the letter there is no room for genuine doubt.</p>
      <h4 id="constantine-the-emperor-to-aelafius">Constantine The
      Emperor To Aelafius</h4>
      <p><a href="#fn1732" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1732" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1732</sup></a></p>
      <p>Already some time back, since it was brought to my knowledge
      that many persons in our dominion of Africa had begun to separate
      from one another with mad fury, and had brought purposeless
      accusations against each other about the keeping of the most holy
      Catholic Law, I thought it well, in order to settle this quarrel,
      that Caecilian the Bishop of Carthage, against whom especially
      they all often petitioned me, should go to the City of Rome, and
      that some of those who had deemed fit to bring certain charges
      against him, should appear as well. I also ordered some Bishops
      from the Gauls to proceed to our above-mentioned City of Rome,
      that, by the integrity of their lives and praiseworthy manner of
      living, together with seven Bishops of the same Communion, and the
      Bishop <a href="#fn1733" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1733" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1733</sup></a> of the City of Rome, and
      their assessors, they might give due attention to the questions
      which had been raised. Now they brought to my knowledge, by the
      written Acts of their meeting, all that had been done in their
      presence, affirming also by word of mouth that their judgement was
      based upon equity, and declaring that not Caecilian, but those who
      brought charges against him, were guilty—so that, after giving
      their judgement, they forbade the latter to go back to Africa.<a href="#fn1734" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1734" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1734</sup></a> Wherefore, in consequence
      of all this I once hoped that, in accordance with the probable
      issue of events, a fitting end had been made to all the seditions
      and contentions of every kind which had been suddenly called into
      being by the other party. But after I had read your letters, which
      you had deemed it your duty to send to Nicasius and the rest,
      about the crafty pretext of these men, I recognised clearly that
      they would not place before their eyes either considerations of
      their own salvation, or (what is of more importance) the reverence
      which is due to Almighty God—for they are persisting in a line of
      action which not merely leads to their shame and disgrace, but
      also gives an opportunity of detraction to those who are known to
      turn their minds away from the keeping of the most holy Catholic
      Law. I write thus because—and this is a thing which it is well
      that you should know—some have come from these men, asserting that
      the above-mentioned Caecilian is deemed not to be worthy of the
      worship of our most holy religion,<a href="#fn1735" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1735" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1735</sup></a> and in answer to my reply
      that they were making an empty boast (since the affair had been
      terminated in the City of Rome by competent men of the highest
      character, who were Bishops), they thought fit to answer with
      persistent obstinacy that the whole case had not been heard, but
      that these Bishops had shut themselves up somewhere and given the
      judgement as was most convenient to themselves.<a href="#fn1736" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1736" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1736</sup></a> Wherefore, since I
      perceived that these numerous and important affairs were being
      pertinaciously delayed by discussions, so that it appeared that no
      end could be made of them without both Caecilian and three of
      those who are making a schism against him coming to the town of
      Arles, for the judgement of those who are opposed to Caecilian,
      and are bound to accept him as Bishop,<a href="#fn1737" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1737" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1737</sup></a> I have deemed it well to
      impose upon your care to provide, as soon as you receive this
      letter of mine, that the above-mentioned Caecilian with some of

      provinces of Byzacium, Tripolis, the Numidias and the Mauritanias,
      and each of the provinces, (and these must bring a certain number
      of their clergy <a href="#fn1738" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1738" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1738</sup></a> whom they

      same way <a href="#fn1740" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1740" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1740</sup></a> you shall provide in Spain

      disgrace.<a href="#fn1743" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1743" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1743</sup></a> As to the rest,<a href="#fn1744" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1744" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1744</sup></a> after the matter has been

      conclusion,<a href="#fn1745" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1745" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1745</sup></a> and be forthwith finished
      and arranged. I confess to your Lordship, since I am well aware
      that you also are a worshipper of the most High God, that I
      consider it by no means right that contentions and altercations of
      this kind should be hidden from me, by which, perchance, God may
      be moved not only against the human race, but also against me
      myself, to whose care, by His heavenly Decree, He has entrusted
      the direction of all human affairs, and may in His wrath provide
      <a href="#fn1746" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1746" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1746</sup></a> otherwise than heretofore.
      For then shall I be able to remain truly and most fully without
      anxiety, and may always hope for all most prosperous and excellent
      things from the ever-ready kindness of the most powerful God, when
      I shall know that all, bound together in brotherly concord, adore
      the most holy God with the worship of the Catholic religion, that
      is His due.</p>

      <p>The authenticity of this letter has never been contested. It is
      to be found, though under a slightly different form, in the
      collection of Canons of Merovingian Gaul, where it has been
      derived, not from African sources, but from the Archives of the
      Church of Arles.</p>
      <p>In all probability a letter was also sent from the Council,
      announcing its decisions, to the Church of Carthage. But if so,
      this letter has been lost.</p>
      <p>In the same way the Council of Sardica, at the conclusion of
      its labours, sent two letters (both extant), one to the Pope, the
      second to the Church of Alexandria. We also possess a letter from
      the Council of Nicaea to Alexandria; the letter from Nicaea to the
      Pope has shared the same fate as the letter from Arles to
      Carthage. That there was such a letter can hardly be doubted. As
      Duchesne writes (p. 15):</p>
      <p>‘Il n’est guère douteux que les légats de Silvestre au Concile
      de Nicée n’aient rapporté une lettre de cette assemblée,

      that by reason of your absence,<a href="#fn1753" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1753" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1753</sup></a> most well-beloved Brother,
      we ought to deal exclusively with those matters, on account of
      which we had been summoned, but we judged that we also should take
      counsel on our own affairs; because, as the countries from which
      we come are different, so events of various kinds will happen
      which we think that we ought to watch and regulate.<a href="#fn1754" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1754" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1754</sup></a> Accordingly we thought well
      in the presence of the Holy Spirit and His Angels that from among
      the various matters which occurred to each of us,<a href="#fn1755" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1755" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1755</sup></a> we should make some decrees
      to provide for the present state of tranquillity. We also agreed
      to write first to you,<a href="#fn1756" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1756" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1756</sup></a> who hold
      <span>[</span>the government of<span>]</span> the greater
      dioceses,<a href="#fn1757" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1757" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1757</sup></a> that by you especially they
      should be brought to the knowledge of all.<a href="#fn1758" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1758" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1758</sup></a> What it is that we have
      determined on, we have appended to this writing of our
      insignificance. But in the first place, we were bound to discuss a
      matter that concerned the usefulness of our life. Now since <a href="#fn1759" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1759" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1759</sup></a> one died and rose again for
      many, the same season should be observed with a religious mind by
      all at the same time, lest divisions or dissensions might arise in
      so great a service of devotion. We judge, therefore, that the
      Pasch of the Lord should be observed throughout the world upon the
      same day.</p>
      <p>Also, concerning those who have been ordained clerics in any
      places whatsoever, we have decreed that they remain fixed in the
      same places. Concerning those too <a href="#fn1760" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1760" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1760</sup></a> who throw down their arms
      in time of peace,<a href="#fn1761" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1761" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1761</sup></a> we have
      decreed that they should be kept from communion. Concerning the
      wandering agitators who belong to the Faithful, we have decreed
      that, as long as they continue their agitation, they be debarred
      from communion.</p>
      <p>Concerning the strolling players we have decreed that, as long
      as they act, they be debarred from communion. Concerning those

      decreed that hands be laid upon them. Concerning magistrates who

      determined that, when they are promoted, they should receive
      ecclesiastical letters of communion, but in such a way that in
      whatever place they may be living, the Bishop of that place shall
      have a heed to them, and if they begin to act against discipline,
      they be then excluded from communion. We have decreed similarly
      with regard to those who wish to hold state offices. Moreover,
      with regard to the Africans,<a href="#fn1764" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1764" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1764</sup></a> inasmuch as
      they use their own law of rebaptising, we have decreed that if any
      heretic comes to the Church, he should be questioned concerning
      the Creed, and if it be found that he has been baptised in the
      Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, hands shall be laid upon
      him and no more.<a href="#fn1765" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1765" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1765</sup></a> But if, on

      Constantini Imperatoris Ad Episcopos Catholicos Post Synodum
      Arelatense Scripta A.D. 314 <em>circa finem.</em></h3>
      <p>Two objections, both of them sufficiently flimsy, have been
      brought against the authenticity of this letter, from which St.
      Optatus quotes twice (i, 23, 25, cf. pp. 44, 49), though, as we
      have seen, he was mistaken as to its date.</p>
      <p>It has been urged that the indignation of Constantine at an
      appeal having been made to him from the decision of the Bishops is
      overdone, and it has been represented that the piety of its
      expressions is strange as emanating from an Emperor in an official
      document. To the first objection we may reply that Constantine
      might well be shocked. As Emperor, he could have no right to
      settle the purely ecclesiastical question who was the legitimate
      Bishop of Carthage, though in this capacity he considered it his
      duty to provide for the ecclesiastical trial of such matters as
      they arose, and deemed himself bound to enforce Catholic law and
      discipline (when it had been duly determined) throughout his
      dominions; as a Christian, he was still in the lowest rank, a
      catechumen. Small wonder then if he was scandalised, and expressed
      his scornful anger, at the behaviour of the Donatists in his
      regard. As for the piety of the tone of this letter, Duchesne
      observes that Constantine’s letter to Chrestus of Syracuse,
      concerning the authenticity of which no one doubts, is equally
      full of pious expressions. Besides, Constantine seems to have been
      fond of preaching to his subjects on occasion. ‘Il a toujours
      beaucoup sermonné ses sujets. Sa vie écrite par Eusèbe et les
      autres documents que l’on a de son activité oratoire en ce genre,
      même certaines lois du code théodosien, nous édifient suffisamment
      là-dessus.’ (<em>Op. cit.</em> p. 39.)</p>
      <p>Moreover, this letter may perhaps have been touched up by an
      ecclesiastical secretary, of whom Constantine had several in his
      household. One of them, Hosius, the celebrated Bishop of Cordova,
      was certainly closely involved in these African controversies (cf.
      Eusebius, <em>E.H.</em> x, 6). However this may be, there is no
      doubt that Constantine felt the bad conduct of the Donatists very
      deeply. Whatever we may think as to the form of this letter, its
      substance is certainly his. Expressions may have been placed upon
      his lips, or made to flow from his pen. But this happens not
      seldom to personages of high estate Whatever was written in an
      official document, such as the one before us, he adopted and made
      his own.</p>
      <h4 id="letter-of-constantine-to-the-catholic-bishops.">Letter of
      Constantine to the Catholic Bishops.</h4>
      <p>Constantine Augustus, to his dearest brothers, the Catholic
      Bishops, Health! The everlasting and worshipful, the
      incomprehensible kindness of our God by no means allows the
      weakness of men to wander for too long a time in the darkness. Nor
      does it suffer the perverse wills of some to come to such a pass
      as not to give them anew by its most splendid light a saving
      passage, opening the way so that they may be converted to the rule
      of justice. I have indeed experienced this by many examples. I can
      also describe it from myself. For in me of old there were things
      that were far from right, nor did I think that the power of God
      saw anything of what I carried amongst the secrets of my heart.
      Surely this ought to have brought me a just retribution, flowing
      over with all evils. But Almighty God, who sitteth in the
      watchtower of Heaven,<a href="#fn1768" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1768" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1768</sup></a> hath
      bestowed upon me gifts which I deserved not. Of a truth, those
      things which of His Heavenly kindness He has granted to me, His
      servant, can neither be told nor counted. On this account, O most
      holy Bishops of Christ the Saviour, my dearest brothers, I indeed
      rejoice; yes, in a special way do I rejoice, that at length, after
      you have held a most impartial inquiry, you have recalled to a
      better hope and fortune those whom the wickedness of the devil
      seemed by his wretched persuasion to have turned away from the
      most noble light of the Catholic Law. Oh, truly triumphant
      Providence of Christ the Saviour, to come to the rescue of those
      who, already falling away from the truth, and in a certain manner
      taking up arms against it, had joined themselves to the Gentiles!
      For, if even now they will consent with pure <a href="#fn1769" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1769" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1769</sup></a> faith to make their
      obedience to the most holy Law, they will be able to understand
      how great a provision has been made for them by the Will of God.
      And this, my most holy brothers, I hoped might be found even in
      those in whom the greatest hardness of heart has been engendered.
      But your right judgement has not been of any avail to them, nor
      has the merciful God made an entrance into their dispositions. In
      truth, not undeservedly has the mercy of Christ departed far from
      those men, in whom it is as clear as the sun of noon-day,<a href="#fn1770" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1770" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1770</sup></a> that they are of such a
      character, as to be seen to be shut off even from the care of
      Heaven, since so great a madness still holds them captive, and
      with unbelievable arrogance they persuade themselves of things
      which cannot lawfully be either spoken or heard—departing from the
      right judgement that was given, from which, as through the
      provision of Heaven I have learnt <a href="#fn1771" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1771" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1771</sup></a> they are appealing to my
      judgement—Oh, what force has the wickedness which even yet is
      persevering in their breasts!</p>
      <p>How often have they been crushed already by myself in a reply,
      which, by their most shameless approaches to me, they have
      deservedly brought upon themselves. Surely, if they had kept this
      before their eyes, they would never have ventured on this appeal
      of theirs. They ask judgement from me, who am myself waiting for
      the judgement of Christ.<a href="#fn1772" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1772" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1772</sup></a> For I
      declare—as is true—that the judgement of Bishops ought to be
      looked upon as if the Lord Himself were sitting in Judgement.<a href="#fn1773" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1773" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1773</sup></a> For it is not lawful for
      them <a href="#fn1774" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1774" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1774</sup></a> to think or to judge in any
      other way, excepting as they have been taught by the teaching of
      Christ.<a href="#fn1775" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1775" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1775</sup></a> Why then, as I have said
      with truth, do wicked men seek the devil’s services? They search
      after worldly things, deserting those which are heavenly.<a href="#fn1776" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1776" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1776</sup></a> Oh, mad daring of their
      rage! They have made an appeal, as is done in the lawsuits of the
      pagans.<a href="#fn1777" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1777" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1777</sup></a> For pagans are accustomed
      sometimes to escape from the lower courts where justice may be
      obtained speedily, and through the authority of higher tribunals
      to have recourse to an appeal. What of those shirkers of the law
      <a href="#fn1778" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1778" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1778</sup></a> who refuse the judgement of
      Heaven, and have thought fit to ask for mine? <a href="#fn1779" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1779" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1779</sup></a> Do they thus think of
      Christ the Saviour? Behold, they are now ‘Betrayers.’ Behold,
      without any need for disputatious examination, of their own accord
      they have themselves betrayed their wicked deeds. How can they,
      who have leapt savagely upon God Himself, feel as men should
      feel?</p>
      <p>But, my dearest Brothers, although this wickedness has been
      discovered in them, nevertheless do you, who follow the way <a href="#fn1780" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1780" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1780</sup></a> of the Lord the Saviour,
      show patience, and still give them a choice to choose what they
      may think well. And if you see that they persevere in the same
      courses, do you go your way, and return to your own Sees, and
      remember me, that our Saviour may always have mercy on me. But I
      have directed my men to bring these wicked deceivers of religion
      to my court that they may live there, and there survey for
      themselves what is worse than death.<a href="#fn1781" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1781" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1781</sup></a> I have also sent a suitable
      letter to the prefect who is my viceroy in Africa, enjoining him,
      that, as often as he finds any instances of this madness, he is to
      send the guilty, forthwith, to my court, lest any longer, beneath
      so great a shining of our God, such things be done by them, as may
      provoke the greatest anger of the Heavenly Providence.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God keep you safe, my dearest Brothers, through
      the ages, in answer to my prayers and yours.</p>

      <p>St. Augustine informs us (<em>Ep.</em> xliii, 20) that, in
      accordance with what we read in this letter, Constantine, after
      the Council of Arles, commanded representatives of both Catholics
      and Donatists to appear before him at Rome. The Donatists
      complied, but on the appointed day Caecilian failed to arrive.
      Constantine thereupon put off his judgement until a later date and
      directed that the Donatists should be conducted under a safeguard
      to Milan. Some of them, however, contrived to escape before
      Caecilian arrived at Milan—to be vindicated a third time from the
      charges which had been so persistently brought against his good
      name.</p>
      <h4 id="constantine-augustus-to-the-donatist-bishops.">Constantine
      Augustus To The Donatist Bishops.</h4>
      <p>A few days ago I determined that, in accordance with your
      demand, you should go back to Africa, so that there the whole
      case, which you think lies against Caecilian, should be tried by
      friends of mine whom I had chosen, and reach a fitting conclusion.
      However, whilst I was thinking it over for a long time, and duly
      turning the matter over in my mind, I deemed it best, rather than
      this—since I know that some of your party are full of turbulence
      and obstinately refuse to regard the right judgement and the
      statement of the complete truth, and that for this reason it would
      perhaps happen, that if the case were tried in Africa it would be
      determined, not as is fitting, and as the demands of truth
      require, but that through your exceedingly great obstinacy
      something might easily result which would both be displeasing to
      God in Heaven, and also would be exceedingly detrimental to my
      good reputation, which I desire always to preserve
      undiminished—that Caecilian should preferably come here, as was
      first settled. Thus, as I have said, I have determined, and I
      believe that, in compliance with my letter, he will soon arrive.
      But I promise you, that if, in his presence, you prove by your
      evidence anything against him concerning even one accusation or
      evil deed, I will regard this the same as though all your charges
      were seen to be proved.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God grant us perpetual safety!</p>

      <p>Du Pin dates this letter 316; but (though Ziwsa follows him in
      printing it after the succeeding letter <em>Perseverare
      Menalium)</em> this must be a mistake. The letter itself concludes
      thus:</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>It is addressed to Celsus who had by April 316 given place to
      Eumelius as Vicar of Africa. It was therefore written in 315. It
      carries into execution Constantine’s permission, of which we have
      just read in the preceding letter, to the Donatist Bishops to
      return to Africa after the Council of Arles. Of itself it has no
      intrinsic importance, but is of some interest in consequence of
      its close connection with the document given by Optatus (i, 23),
      containing the names of the obscure signatories of the famous
      appeal to Constantine. Optatus records the names of Lucianus,
      Dignus, Nasutius, Capito and Fidentius. These all reappear in the
      document before us, excepting Dignus, who perhaps had died at
      Arles.</p>

      <p>This letter was written by Constantino during the interval that
      elapsed between the appearance of the Donatists at Rome and the
      judgement at Milan. It betrays considerable irritation even
      against Caecilian, due no doubt to the fact that he had failed to
      obey the Emperor’s summons (given in a letter no longer extant) to
      Rome. Constantine in this letter expresses a new
      determination—which he failed to carry out—to go himself to Africa
      and investigate the conditions on the spot. Since Constantine
      mentions in this letter the ‘flight’ of some of the Donatists as
      having already taken place, it was not written before September
      315, when the Emperor left Rome; on the other hand it must have
      been written before Celsus was succeeded as Vicar of Africa by
      Eumelius early in 316. We are thus enabled to fix its date, as
      having been written in the autumn of 315 or the winter of
      315-316.</p>

      took hold of, and the others who have departed from the truth of
      God, and given themselves over to a most shameful error, persevere

      Brother, that you have obeyed my order with regard to the
      seditious in accordance with their deserts, and have placed a
      check upon the tumult which they were preparing. And now that they
      were contemplating wicked deeds has become manifest from the fact
      that, when I had determined to inquire most fully between them and
      Caecilian, concerning the various charges which they brought
      against him, they did their best to withdraw from my presence by
      taking to flight.<a href="#fn1787" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1787" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1787</sup></a> By this most
      disgraceful deed they acknowledged that they were hastening to
      return to the things which they both had done previously and are
      now persisting in doing. But (since it is certain that no one ever
      gains an unmixed advantage from his own misdeeds, even though
      punishment may be delayed for a little while), I have thought well
      to command your Lordship that in the meantime you should leave
      them alone,<a href="#fn1788" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1788" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1788</sup></a> and understand that we must

      <p>But after you have read this letter, you should make it plain
      both to Caecilian and to them, that when by the Divine Goodness I

      Caecilian, and to those who are acting against him, by reading a
      perfectly plain judgement, as to what and what kind <a href="#fn1790" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1790" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1790</sup></a> of worship is to be given
      to the Supreme God, and with what manner of service He is pleased.
      Also, by diligent examination, I shall acquaint myself to the full
      with the things which at the present time some persons fancy they
      can keep dark through the allurements <a href="#fn1791" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1791" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1791</sup></a> of their ignorant minds,
      and shall drag them into the light. Those same persons who now
      stir up the people in such a war as to bring it about that the
      supreme God is not worshipped with the veneration that is His due,

      <p>\chapter{Epistola Constantini Imperatoris Ad Episcopos Et
      Plebem Africae, Ut DOnatistas Tolerent. A.D. 321</p>
      <p>This letter speaks for itself. It seems to be contemporaneous
      with the Rescript of Verinus (May 5, 321). Its object is to inform
      the Catholics of Africa that the Government had changed its plan
      of dealing with the recalcitrant Donatists. Rigorous measures were
      to be abandoned, and toleration granted, in the hope of attaining
      good results in the end. With regard to this new determination
      Duchesne writes as follows (<em>op. cit.</em> p. 28):</p>
      <p>‘This toleration, in face of the fanaticism, of the audacity
      and the violence of the schismatics, was in reality an
      abandonment. Without doubt the Emperor exhorts the Catholic
      Bishops to endure with patience the wrongs inflicted upon them by
      the Donatists; he also makes reparation, up to a certain point,
      for the material damage caused by these sectaries, but this does
      not make it less true that he tolerates them. In thus granting
      them toleration, he goes back upon his much more decided attitude
      anterior to the Rescript of 321 and allows the judgement to fall
      into abeyance, which he had himself given against Donatus and in
      favour of Caecilian.’</p>
      <h4 id="letter-of-constantine-on-toleration-to-be-granted-to-the-donatists.">Letter
      of Constantine on Toleration to be granted to the Donatists.</h4>
      <p>Constantine Augustus to all the Bishops in Africa and to the
      people of the Catholic Church. You know right well that, as Faith
      required, so far as Prudence permitted, as much as a single-minded
      intention <a href="#fn1797" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1797" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1797</sup></a> could prevail, I have
      endeavoured by every effort of kindly government to secure that,
      in accordance with the prescriptions of our law, the Peace of the
      most holy Brotherhood,<a href="#fn1798" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1798" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1798</sup></a> whose grace
      the supreme God has poured into the hearts of His servants,
      should, through complete concord, be preserved secure. ’But
      whereas the provisions that we have made have not prevailed to
      subdue the obstinate violence of crime, which has been implanted
      in the breasts of certain men—few though they be—and whereas some
      favour is still shown to this wickedness of theirs, so that they
      would not on any account suffer a place in which they were proud
      to have sinned<a href="#fn1799" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1799" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1799</sup></a> to be
      extorted from them, we must see to it, that as all this evil
      affects a few, it may be, through the mercy of Almighty God,
      mitigated for the people. For we ought to hope for a remedy, from
      that source to which all good desires and deeds are referred.<a href="#fn1800" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1800" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1800</sup></a> But, until the Heavenly
      medicine shows itself, our designs must be moderated so far as to
      act with patience, and whatever in their insolence they attempt or
      carry out, in accordance with their habitual wantonness—all this
      we must endure with the strength which comes from tranquillity. In
      no way let wrong be returned to wrong, for it is the mark of a
      fool to snatch at that vengeance which we ought to leave to God,
      especially since our faith ought to lead us to trust that whatever
      we may endure from the madness of men of this kind, will avail
      before God for the grace of martyrdom. For what is it, to overcome
      in this world in the Name of God, excepting to endure with an
      unshaken heart the untamed savagery of men who harass the people
      of the Law of Peace? But, if you will give yourselves loyally to
      this affair, you will speedily bring it about that, by the favour
      of God on high, these men, who are making themselves the
      standard-bearers of this most miserable strife, may all come to
      recognise, as their laws <a href="#fn1801" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1801" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1801</sup></a> or customs

      might, through the grace of repentance, be made whole again,
      having corrected their errors, for everlasting life.</p>

      <p>In this Rescript Constantine provides that, as the Donatists
      refused to give back to Catholics their basilicas—amongst which
      was one that he had himself built for their use—the Donatists
      should, lest worse things befall, be left in undisturbed
      possession of their ill-gotten goods, and that a new Church should
      be built, again at his expense, to provide for the religious needs
      of Catholics. He also states that he had ordered that certain
      exemptions, relative to the <em>curia</em> and <em>munera
      personalia,</em> of which the Donatists had succeeded by their
      intrigues in depriving Catholic clerics of lower degree, should be
      restored to them, according to a custom which was already
      ancient.</p>
      <p>Duchesne has shown (<em>op. cit.</em> pp. 28, 29) that certain
      passages in this letter are in even verbal accord with the

      <p>Constantine evidently was as good as his word. He dated, and no
      doubt despatched, his letters on the same day to the Numidian
      Bishops and his Prefect in Africa. Would that Princes had always
      thus faithfully kept their promises to the Church.</p>
      <h4 id="rescript-of-constantine-to-the-bishops-of-numidia.">Rescript
      of Constantine to the Bishops of Numidia.</h4>
      <p>Constantine the supreme Victor and always triumphant Emperor,
      to Zenuzius, Gallicus, Victorinus, Sperantius, Januarius, Felix,
      Crescentius, Pontius, Victor, Babbertius, Donatus, Bishops.</p>
      <p>Since this is certainly the Will of the Supreme God, who is the
      Author of this world and its Father, (through whose goodness we
      enjoy life, look up to heaven, and rejoice in the society of our
      fellow-men), that the whole human race should agree together and
      be joined in a certain affectionate union by, as it were, a mutual
      embrace, it is not doubtful that heresies and schism have come
      from the devil, who is the head of wickedness. Therefore, there is
      no room to doubt that whatever heretics do, is done through his
      prompting who has taken possession of their senses, minds and
      thoughts. For, when he has reduced men of this character beneath
      his power, he rules them in every sort of fashion. And what good
      thing can be done by a man who is insane, unbelieving,
      irreligious, profane, opposed to God, an enemy of the Holy Church,
      who (departing from God, the Holy, the True, the Just, the
      Supreme, and the Lord of all, from Him who has given us life and
      preserved us in this world—having bestowed upon us breath for the
      life which we enjoy, and willed us to have, that which is His own
      <a href="#fn1807" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1807" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1807</sup></a> —and has made all things
      perfect by His Will) runs on the downward path to the side of the
      devil? But, inasmuch as the soul which has once been possessed by
      the Evil One—for it must needs do the works of its teacher—does
      those things which are opposed to equity and justice, it follows
      that they who have been possessed by the devil yield themselves to
      his falsehood and wickedness. Moreover, it is not to be wondered
      at <a href="#fn1808" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1808" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1808</sup></a> that the wicked depart from
      the good, for thus has it been rightly laid down in the proverb,
      ‘Like flock with like together.’ <a href="#fn1809" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1809" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1809</sup></a> It must needs be that those
      who have been stained with the evil of an impious mind should
      depart from our fellowship. For, as Scripture says, the wicked man
      brings forth wicked things from a wicked treasure,<a href="#fn1810" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1810" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1810</sup></a> but the good man brings
      forth good from good. But since (as we have said) heretics and
      schismatics, who, deserting good and following after evil, do the
      things that are displeasing to God, are proved to cling to the
      devil, who is their father, most rightly and wisely has your
      Gravity <a href="#fn1811" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1811" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1811</sup></a> acted in accordance with
      the holy precepts of the Faith, by abstaining from contending with
      their perversity, and giving them the use of that which they claim
      for themselves, though they have no right to it, and it does not
      belong to them, lest—so great is their wicked and shameless
      perversity—they might even break out into tumults, and stir up men
      like themselves at their crowded meetings, and thus a state of
      sedition might be produced, which could not be allayed. For their
      criminal purpose always requires them to do the works of the
      devil. Therefore, since the Bishops of God overcome them, together
      with their father himself,<a href="#fn1812" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1812" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1812</sup></a> by patience,
      let those who are the worshippers of the Supreme God obtain glory
      for themselves, but these others condemnation and condign
      punishments. In fact, may the Judgement of the Supreme God become
      the more imposing and appear <a href="#fn1813" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1813" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1813</sup></a> the more just from this,
      that He bears with them in calmness, and His patience condemns all
      the deeds which have come from them, enduring them for a while,
      for God indeed has declared that He is the Avenger of all. So when
      vengeance is reserved to God, the enemy is punished the more
      severely. And I have now been informed that you, the servants of
      God, have done this willingly, and I have rejoiced that you demand
      no punishment upon the impious and wicked, the sacrilegious and
      profane, the perfidious and irreligious, upon those who displease
      God and are the enemies of the Church, but rather ask that they
      should be pardoned. This is to know God truly and thoroughly, this
      is to walk in the way of His Commandments, this is to believe with
      happiness, this is to think with truth, this is to understand that
      when the enemies of the Church are spared in this world, the
      greater punishment is laid up against them for hereafter.</p>
      <p>I have learnt by the receipt of the letter of your Wisdom and
      Dignity, that the heretics or schismatics, with their accustomed
      wickedness, determined to seize the basilicas belonging to the
      Catholic Church, which I had ordered to be built in the City of
      Constantine,<a href="#fn1814" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1814" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1814</sup></a> and that, though they had
      been often warned, both by us and by our judges at our command, to
      give up what was not theirs, they have refused to do so, but that
      you, imitating the Patience of the most high God, with a calm mind
      relinquish to their wickedness what is yours, and ask instead for
      another site for yourselves in exchange, namely the Custom House.
      This petition of yours I gladly welcomed, according to my custom,
      and straightway sent a suitable letter to the accountant,<a href="#fn1815" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1815" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1815</sup></a> commanding him to see that
      our Custom House should be passed over, with all its rights, to
      the ownership of the Catholic Church. I have given you this with
      ready liberality, and have ordered it to be at once delivered to
      you. I have also commanded a basilica to be built on that spot at
      the Imperial expense, and have directed letters to be written to
      the Consular of Numidia,<a href="#fn1816" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1816" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1816</sup></a> telling him
      to be of assistance to your Holiness in all things which concern
      the building of this Church. I have also decreed, in accordance
      with my Statute law, that the lectors and subdeacons <a href="#fn1817" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1817" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1817</sup></a> of the Catholic Church, and
      any others who, by the command of the above-mentioned, have been
      summoned in consequence of their fitness, to public offices, or to
      the decurionship, should be free from all public obligations <a href="#fn1818" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1818" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1818</sup></a>; also we have provided that
      those who at the instigation of heretics had been summoned, should
      forthwith be set free from disagreeable duties.<a href="#fn1819" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1819" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1819</sup></a> For the rest I have also
      ordered that the law which I have made concerning Catholic
      ecclesiastics be observed. All these things have been written out
      at length, as this letter testifies, in order that they may be
      made known to your patience. And indeed, oh that the heretics or
      schismatics would at length provide for their own salvation, and
      that, having wiped away the darkness from their eyes, they would
      open them to the vision of true light, and that they would depart
      from the devil, and, however late, would flee to God, who is One
      and True, and the Judge of all mankind. But, since it is clear
      that they are remaining in their malice, and wish to die in their
      crimes, our warning and former careful exhortation is enough for
      them. For if they had been willing to obey our commands, they
      would have been freed from all evil. Let us, however, my Brothers,
      follow after the things that are ours, let us walk in the way of
      the Commandments, let us by good actions keep the Divine Precepts,
      let us free our life from errors and with the help of the mercy of
      God, let us direct it along the right path.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Purpurius answered:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>‘Do you think that I am frightened of you, like the rest? What
      have <em>you</em> done, who were forced by the Curator and the
      soldiers to give up the Scriptures? How did you come to be set
      free by them, unless you surrendered something, or ordered it to
      be surrendered? For they did not let you go at random. Yes, I did
      kill, and I intend now to kill those who act against me. So do not
      now provoke me to say anything more. You know that I interfere
      with nobody’s affairs.’</p>

      are accused by you. I know that they intend to abandon you, and
      pronounce sentence against you. You will then remain alone, a
      heretic. So what business is it of yours what any one has done? He
      has to render an account to God.’</p>

      <p>We have here a report of the Pro-Consul Anulinus to
      Constantine, informing him that he had duly sent his letter to
      Caecilian, but that a few days afterwards he had been approached
      by a deputation, followed by a crowd of people, requesting him to
      transmit two documents—one sealed, the other open—to the Emperor
      (cf. Opt. i, 22).</p>
      <p>This document was produced in its entirety by the Catholics at
      the Carthage Conference (<em>Gesta Coll. Carthag. diei</em> iii,

      and the Catholic Church was protected—they should apply themselves
      to the service of their holy Law and to the things of God, with

      certain persons, followed by a great throng of the populace, who

      should send them to the sacred and venerable Court of your
      Highness. This my littleness has been careful to do (preserving
      Caecilian in his position), and I have forwarded their Acts, that
      your Majesty may be in a position to determine everything. I have
      sent the two <em>libelli,</em> of which the one bound in leather

      <p>The Emperors Constantine Maximus and Valerius Licinius Caesars
      to Probianus the Pro-Consul of Africa.</p>
      <p>Your predecessor Aelianus at a time when he was discharging the
      duties of that most worthy man, Verus our Vicar, in consequence of
      his ill-health, thought well (and with reason), amongst other
      matters, to investigate and determine the business—that is, the
      charges—brought by envy against Caecilian, a Bishop of the
      Catholic Church. For after he had secured the presence of Superius
      the centurion, and Caecilianus the Magistrate of Aptunga, and
      Saturninus <a href="#fn1836" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1836" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1836</sup></a> who was formerly
      <em>Curator,</em> and Calidius <a href="#fn1837" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1837" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1837</sup></a> the younger Curator, and
      Solon a public official of that city, he gave them a fair
      hearing—so that when it was alleged as an objection against
      Caecilian that he had been raised to the Episcopate by Felix, who
      was accused of the Betrayal and burning of the Divine Scriptures,
      the innocence of Felix was proved. Finally, when Maximus charged
      Ingentius, a decurion of Ziqua, with having falsified a letter of
      Caecilianus formerly Duovir, we have learned from the Acts of the
      Proceedings that this Ingentius was prepared for torture, and was
      only saved by his statement that he was a decurion of Ziqua.<a href="#fn1838" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1838" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1838</sup></a> Wherefore it is our will
      that you should despatch this Ingentius, under suitable escort, to
      my Court of Constantine Augustus,<a href="#fn1839" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1839" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1839</sup></a> so that it may be made
      quite clear, in the presence and hearing of those who are
      concerned with this affair, and for some time past have been
      incessantly appealing to me, that it is to no purpose that they
      show their malice against Caecilian the Bishop and have been
      pleased to bestir themselves against him with violence. So will it
      be brought to pass that these disputes having ceased, as is right,
      the people may without any dissension serve their religion <a href="#fn1840" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1840" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1840</sup></a> with the reverence that is

      <p>Hail, Anulinus, most highly esteemed by us! After this manner

      title belong to others should not only remain unmolested, but
      also, when necessary, be restored, most esteemed Anulinus!
      Wherefore we decree that, so soon as you have received this
      letter, if any of those things which belong to the Catholic Church
      of the Christians, in the several cities or other places, are held
      by Decurions or by any others, these you shall cause immediately
      to be restored to their churches. For we have determined that
      whatever these same churches formerly possessed shall be restored
      in accordance with justice. When therefore your Fidelity <a href="#fn1841" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1841" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1841</sup></a> has understood that this
      decree of our orders is most clear, you will make haste to see
      that everything, whether gardens or houses, or whatever else
      belongs to these churches, be restored to them as soon as may be
      possible—that we may learn that you have attended to, and most
      carefully carried into execution, this our decree. Farewell, my

      <p>Hail, Anulinus, most highly esteemed by us! Whereas from many
      incidents it is abundantly clear that whenever the religion, by
      which the supreme reverence due to the Divine Majesty is guarded,
      has been held in contempt, the greatest perils have overtaken the
      State, and whereas this religion, when it has been duly accepted
      and protected, has, through the goodness of God, conferred the
      highest prosperity on the Roman name and has given their chief
      benefits to all human affairs—We have resolved that those men, who
      with due piety and careful observance of this Law, have given
      their service to the divine worship, should receive the recompence
      for their labours, O most esteemed Anulinus!</p>
      <p>Wherefore it is our will that those men called Clerics, who
      within the Province entrusted to your care serve this most holy
      religion in the Catholic Church, over which Caecilian presides,
      shall be held totally exempt from all public offices, to the end
      that they may not, through some mistake or sacrilegious deviation,
      be drawn away from the service which is due to God Most High; but
      may be free to serve their own Law without any disturbance. For
      through their showing supreme reverence to God, the very greatest
      advantage will accrue to the Commonwealth. Farewell, my most
      esteemed and beloved Anulinus!</p>

      these words as those of Optatus. I think, however, that there can
      be no doubt that they are really pseudo-Optatus. (See my
      Introduction to Book vii, p. 272.)<a href="#fnref51" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn52"><p><em>Cunctos nos Christianos, clarissimi fratres,
      Omnipotenti Deo fides una commendat.</em> With these striking
      words St. Optatus opens his work against the Donatists. <em>Fides
      una</em>—the One Faith, untainted by any specific heresy. St.
      Optatus insists more than once, with emphasis, that he does not
      charge those against whom he writes with heresy (sin against
      faith), but with schism (sin against unity) (cf. i, 9; i, 12; iii,
      9; v, i), and complains (i, 10) that Parmenian paid no attention
      to this essential distinction. St. Augustine, however, in his
      second Book against Cresconius explains the reasons why the
      Donatists of his time deserved to be called heretics, and in his
      Book on Heresies he hardly ever gives them any other name,
      explaining at length that their schism had now become a heresy. In
      this it did but follow a usual law. ‘Haeresis scisma inveteratum.’
      These are the words of St. Augustine, and St. Jerome writes to the
      same effect: (<em>Ep. ad Tit.</em> iii) ‘An erroneous doctrine
      constitutes heresy; schism is separation from, the Church, through
      the departure of a Bishop (or of Bishops). But there is no schism
      which fails to frame for itself some heresy, that it may form a
      pretext for having departed from the Church.’ St. Augustine tells
      us further that Donatus the Great was heretical about the Trinity,
      though the fact was generally unknown to his followers. He also
      writes (<em>Ep.</em> clxiii) that he had heard that the Arians had
      endeavoured to make common cause with Donatists in Africa.<a href="#fnref52" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn53"><p><em>fratres.</em> St. Optatus will proceed
      immediately to justify himself at considerable length for terming
      the Donatists his <em>brethren,</em> notwithstanding the fact that
      they were schismatics, and therefore his ‘separated brethren’ (i,
      3; cf. iv, 1; iv, 2). So also St. Augustine: ‘Quotidie enim
      quibusdam non nobiscum in una Ecclesia, nec in iisdem Sacramentis
      constitutis, dicimus, <em>Frater.</em> Sodomitis etiam dixit Loth,
      <em>Fratres</em> (Gen. xix, 7), utique ad leniendum eorum
      animositatem, non ad cognitam fraternitatem, quasi unius
      haereditate consortium.’ (<em>Gesta Collationis Carthag. diei</em>
      iii, ccxlii). Cf. Aug. <em>cont. Parm.</em> iii, 2.<a href="#fnref53" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn54"><p><em>commendat.</em> Ziwsa says that
      <em>commendat</em> here = <em>tutelae Dei mandat</em> (cf. the
      prayer of the Church, e.g. in Fest. S. Antonii, ‘Intercessio nos,
      quaesumus Domine, beati Antonii Abbatis commendet’). Casaubon
      thinks that it means either: ‘One Faith <em>approves</em> us all,
      who are Christians, to Almighty God’ (i.e. makes us pleasing to
      Him); or ‘One Faith <em>proves</em> that, in the sight of Almighty
      God, we all are Christians.’ (Cf. S. August. <em>Brev. Coll.</em>
      iii, 10: ‘Donatistae Scripturarum testimonio unam Ecclesiam
      commendaverant.’ The Donatists had <em>proved</em> by the witness
      of the Scriptures that the Church is One.) It must, however, be
      admitted that it is not possible to produce a passage, at least
      from the works of St. Augustine, in which <em>commendare</em> is
      vised in this sense with the Dative, as above <em>Omnipotenti

      <li id="fn58"><p><em>Itoriam</em> P. <em>Storiam</em> RB.
      <em>Victricem</em> G. This last reading is evidently a desperate,
      though brilliant guess (‘He bequeathed victorious peace’). It is,
      however, adopted by Du Pin, who observes that it seems impossible
      to translate <em>storiam.</em> Ziwsa reads <em>storiam,</em> and
      tells us that it here means not as usually, a carpet, but a
      breastplate (<em>Schutzwehr</em>) (’ He left peace as a
      breastplate’). Du Pin (not knowing P) did not see
      <em>Itoriam.</em> Evidently Ziwsa put it aside as a hopeless
      corruption. Yet without doubt it is the true reading, for, as Dom
      John Chapman O.S.B. has pointed out to me, this word has been
      discovered with its explanation by the learned Dom Germain Morin
      O.S.B. in an unpublished sermon of St. Augustine (see <em>Revue
      Bénéd.</em> 1895 xii, p. 388). ‘Loquebatur cum Apostolis suis
      ascensurus. Videamus qualia illis reliquit, sicut dici solet
      ITORIA. Humanae conditionis est quod dico, ut quando ab amicis
      amici deducuntur (are conducted a little way on their departure),
      quando ille qui deducitur discedere caeperit, quia necesse est ut
      relinquat in animo diligentium se nonnullam tristitiam, dat eis
      aliquid pecuniae, unde illis eadem dies, sicut dicitur, bene sit,
      id est, unde convivant, simrd laetentur et iucundentur. Et haec
      quantulacunque pecunia quae datur, hilari nomine ITORIA nuncupatur
      (This small sum of money is jokingly called ’Journey Money’). Quid
      dimisit Dominus Ihesus discipulis suis? Exultate, adtentite, quia
      ITORIA illa non solum illos inebriavit, sed ad nos usque manebit .
      . . (and further on) Eritis Mihi testes in Ierusalem. Primo ibi,
      ubi sum occisus, ibi ero gloriosus. In Ierusalem et in totam
      Iudaeam et Samariam. Et adhuc parum est. Et usque in totam terram.
      O! ITORIA! ’ Thus we have two forms of <em>Itoria</em> (1) neuter
      plural with <em>qualia</em> and by itself, (2) feminine singular
      <em>itoria illa . . . inebriavit.</em> Evidently it is an
      adjectival form, in popular use <em>(sicut dici solet,
      itoria),</em> and doubtful number (1) as a substantive = neuter
      plural, (2) in feminine <em>illa itoria, (sc. pecunia).</em> St.
      Augustine makes Our Lord’s <em>itoria</em> (parting gift) to His
      disciples and to His Church <em>(ad nos usque manebit)</em> the
      right of preaching throughout the world; St. Optatus (in
      accordance with the purpose of his treatise) makes it Peace. ‘He
      left us Peace as His parting gift—to all of us, in the person of
      His Apostles.’<a href="#fnref58" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn59"><p>St. Optatus throughout his work continually uses

      used in the Athanasian Creed of the Catholic Faith: ‘Catholicam

      Optatus develops this thought in iv, 6 where he accuses the
      Donatists of saying to God—dwelling in the soul of the Catholic:
      ‘<em>Maledicte,</em> exi foras.’ In both passages he refers to Ez.
      xiii, 19, where he reads ‘<em>maledicebant Mihi.</em>’ (The

      <li id="fn116"><p>Mr. Sparrow Simpson, professing to paraphrase
      St. Optatus, writes as follows: ‘Plainly these Donatists are
      schismatics. Although they are not in the Catholic Church, yet
      they are in possession of the same two Sacraments as the
      Catholics. They are not heretics. Heretics could not be in
      possession of true Sacraments, so Optatus teaches.’ St. Optatus
      teaches (1) that Baptism in the Name of the Trinity is valid (v,
      3); (2) that Baptism by heretics who falsified the Creed (and
      consequently the Baptismal Formula) is ‘varium et falsum’ (i, 12;
      cf. v, 13); (3) that certain heretics of this character, whom he
      specifies, ‘have not the Sacraments,’ also that they are
      ‘separated from Catholic Sacraments’ (i, 10); (4) that heretics in
      general are without ‘Sacramenta legalia’ <em>(id.),</em> and ‘are
      strangers to the Sacraments of the Catholic Church’ (i, 5). This
      exhausts the teaching of Optatus on this subject: Mr. Sparrow
      Simpson would himself call Nestorians and Eutychians heretics; he
      would say rightly that though they possess true Sacraments, they
      cannot use them lawfully; Mr. Sparrow Simpson allows himself to
      slip in the word <em>two</em> before <em>Sacraments.</em> St.
      Optatus nowhere writes of ‘<em>two’</em> or of’<em>the same
      two</em> Sacraments.’ (<em>St. Augustine and the African Church

      <li id="fn130"><p>This is exceedingly obscure, and means of
      illustrating it from other writings of the Fathers are so scanty
      as to be practically nonexistent. What is meant by the
      <em>Ring?</em> Albaspinaeus understands it of Absolution, and
      quotes a passage, which he claims to be relevant, from Tertullian
      <em>(De Pudicitia).</em> Casaubon will not have this at all. He
      understands it, though with hesitation, of the Ring with which, at
      certain fixed periods of the year, the baptisteries were sealed.
      Du Pin understands it either of baptism, for which he also quotes
      from Tertullian <em>(De Poenitentia),</em> or of the Creed. For
      the last interpretation Optatus himself may perhaps be quoted. He
      writes (ii, 8): ‘Sigillum integrum (<em>id est Symbolum
      Catholicum)</em> non habentes ad fontem verum aperire non
      possunt,’ and (i, 12): ‘Bene subdixisti anulum iis, quibus aperire
      non licet ad fontem.’ If, as is at least, highly probable,
      <em>anulus = sigillum,</em> this settles the question. (Cf. Aug.
      <em>in Ioan.</em> lxxx, 2: ‘Accedit verbum ad elementum et fit

      <li id="fn136"><p><em>Cathedra Petri.</em> The manner in which St.
      Optatus goes first to the See of Peter and only in the second
      place to the local See of Carthage, in order to prove that the
      Donatists were in schism, is a fact of the greatest significance.
      It is quite clear that, in the eyes of Optatus, any bishop out of
      communion with the See of Rome was <em>ipso facto</em> schismatic.
      Otherwise, the reference to the Chair of Peter in this connection
      is utterly meaningless and unintelligible. Moreover, it is evident
      that Optatus expects the Donatists immediately to recognise the
      force of this argument. Without hesitation he appeals to them as
      follows: <em>Cum haec ita gesta esse manifestissime constet.</em>
      Now the facts which are here stated to be ‘most clearly certain’
      are that Caecilian did not desert either the Apostolic See of
      Peter or the local See of Cyprian, and that consequently
      Majorinus, his rival, though consecrated by an influential party
      to the See of Carthage, ‘began with himself.’ Parmenian would no
      doubt have angrily denied that Majorinus was out of communion with
      the See of Cyprian; he could not possibly deny that Majorinus was
      out of communion with the See of Peter. This, in the eyes of

      the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. (Cf.
      note i, p. 17.) Mr. Sparrow Simpson writes (op. cit. p.44):
      ‘Heresy is surrender of the Creed,’ and in a footnote gives
      ‘<em>qui falsaverunt Symbolum.’</em> Heresy, according to Optatus,
      is something worse even than ’surrender.’ It is ‘falsification,’
      the substitution of false teaching for true. And so has it ever
      been with heretics in every age. Luther, for example, was not
      content with ‘surrendering’ the doctrines of the supreme authority
      of the Church in the interpretation of Holy Scripture, and of
      salvation through ‘Faith working by Charity.’ He ‘falsified’ them,

      <li id="fn168"><p>The application of the term <em>sacerdotium</em>
      to deacons cannot, I think, be found anywhere in antiquity
      excepting in this passage. Not many years after the death of St.
      Optatus, the Fathers at the Council of Carthage made the following
      distinction: ‘When a deacon is ordained, it is the Bishop alone
      (without the imposition of hands of other priests) who blesses
      him, placing his hand upon his head, because he is consecrated,
      not to the <em>sacerdotium,</em> but to the ministry of service
      <em>(ministerium).’</em> The word <em>sacerdos</em> was used of
      either bishops or priests, <em>episcopus</em> being reserved for
      the first degree, and <em>presbyter</em> for the second degree, of
      the sacred ministry. It is very curious to read these words in the
      Canon Law <em>(Dist.</em> 31 Can. 14) ’Aliter se Orientalium
      traditio habet Ecclesiarum, aliter huius Sanctae Romanae
      Ecclesiae. Nam illarum sacerdotes diaconi et subdiaconi matrimonio
      copulantur. Istius autem Ecclesiae vel Occidentalium nullus
      sacerdotum a subdiacono usque ad episcopum licentiam habet
      coniugium sortiendi.’ As far as I can discover, this is the only

      for the Bishops of that province to come to Carthage for the
      election. The other provinces were too far off. On this occasion
      only the nearest Bishops of Africa Proconsularis were assembled.
      But the vote of the clergy and people of Carthage, approved by a

      we find in combination the lust of the flesh—(the shameless
      woman)—the pride of life—(worldly ambition)—the lust of the
      eyes—(the love of gold)—as the three co-operating causes of the
      Donatist Schism. Before the mind of an English reader another sad
      schism will come with extraordinary vividness. History has
      repeated itself indeed—has shown how the anger of another
      shameless woman (also <em>potens et factiosa femina,</em> also in
      the end <em>confusa),</em> co-operating with the ambition of
      worldly ecclesiastics, together with the lust of the eyes and the
      lust of gold of a monarch, destroyed that ‘parting gift of Peace’
      from Christ our Lord, which had reigned amongst all English
      Christians for more than a thousand years, and produced a
      Division, over which we grieve to-day. If Optatus might, without
      breach of charity, recall the memory of Lucilla, Majorinus, Botrus
      and Celestius, we too may, in like manner, without reproach,
      remember Anne, Cranmer, Henry and Elizabeth.<br />
      St. Augustine tells us (<em>Ep.</em> clxii) that a woman like
      Lucilla was subsequently the cause of a schism within a schism—of

      should have had all the more fear of violating the peace of unity,
      on account of the greatness and fame of Carthage. If an evil
      started there, it would pour itself over the whole of Africa,
      since it was near Italy, and of great celebrity. For this very
      reason its Bishop had a very great position <em>(non mediocris
      utique auctoritatis),</em> nor need he pay attention to the
      numbers of enemies who conspired against him, when he saw himself
      in union, by letters of communion, both with the Roman Church, in
      which the princedom of the Apostolic Chair has always nourished
      (<em>in qua semper Apostolicae Cathedrae viguit
      principatus)</em>—and with the rest of the world—whence the Gospel
      came to Africa, and where he was ready to plead his cause, should
      his adversaries attempt to alienate those churches from him.’ We
      may observe that here we see once again the two proofs of a
      position of ecclesiastical security, quite distinct, but actually
      inseparable, firstly to be in communion with the Apostolic See of
      Rome, secondly to be in communion with all other Catholic Bishops
      throughout the world.<a href="#fnref203" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      come and ordain me yourselves. You ought to do this, on your own

      Caecilian, even though it had been accepted by his adversaries.

      opportunity, if they really had possessed any arguments against

      <li id="fn239"><p><em>et ceteris Episcopis partis Donati.</em>
      Mgr. Duchesne <em>(Le Dossier du Donatisme,</em> p. 25) (who takes
      for granted the existence of Donatus, Bishop of Black Huts, see
      note 3, p. 45) thinks that either these words did not belong to
      the original document and were added by Optatus as a resume of the
      signatures, or that Optatus deliberately (‘se soit cru permis d’y
      substituer’) changed the word <em>Maiorini</em> to
      <em>Donati,</em> since by the time when Optatus wrote, <em>pars
      Donati</em> had become the usual and recognised designation of the
      Donatist party. Du Pin had already made the same suggestion (‘ipse
      Optatus nomen notius substituit in locum antiqui’). But neither Du
      Pin nor Duchesne can have adverted to the fact that Optatus later
      on (iii, 3) founds an argument in two separate passages upon the
      use which he supposed the Donatist clerics to have made of the
      expression <em>partis Donati</em> in this petition. The difficulty
      concerning the employment of these words at this period is
      twofold. (1) The party could hardly have been yet termed <em>pars
      Donati.</em> We do not hear of any Donatus as in any sense their
      leader until the Synod under Miltiades. (2) We read in the
      <em>Gesta Coll. Carthag. (diei</em> iii, ccxxx) that two
      <em>libelli</em> were sent to Constantine, the first of which was
      endorsed ‘<em>Libellus Ecclesiae Catholicae</em> criminum
      Caeciliani traditus a <em>parte Maiorini’</em> (cf. also S. Aug.
      <em>Ep.</em> lxxxviii). For those who believe that Majorinus was
      dead and Donatus was Bishop of Carthage before the Synod under
      Miltiades commenced (see note 3, p. 45) the objection raised
      against the words <em>Partis Donati</em> would at once vanish,
      were it not for the second difficulty—the difficulty arising from
      the fact that the <em>Gesta Collationis Carthagiensis</em> and the
      testimony of St. Augustine prove beyond dispute that this document
      was presented <em>ex parte Maiorini. ’</em>Quinto loco haec acta
      sunt. Recitatae sunt duae relationes . . . una quae ostendit
      Maiores Donatistarum id est <em>de parte Maiorini’ (Brev. coll.
      diei tert.</em> xii). Balduinus falls back on the ingenious
      hypothesis that the <em>first</em> document was endorsed <em>de
      parte Maiorini,</em> the <em>second de parte Donati.</em> But
      unfortunately for this view St. Augustine <em>(id.)</em> gives a
      brief summary of this second document, which shows that it was by
      no means identical with that set out by St. Optatus. After
      everything has been weighed, we can only suppose either that (as
      seems to me most probable) the copy <em>(exemplum)</em> seen by
      Optatus really contained the words <em>partis Donati,</em> or that
      he wrote from memory and through a slip (not unnatural under the
      circumstances of his time and place) wrote <em>Donati</em> when,
      if his memory had not played him tricks, or rather if he had
      scrutinised his original more carefully, he would have written
      <em>Maiorini.</em> We know that on several occasions he made
      similar slips when quoting from Holy Scripture.<br />
      Dom John Chapman writes as follows: <em>(Donatus the Great and
      Donatus of Casae Nigrae, Rev. Bénédictine,</em> Janvier 1909):
      ’The Bishops who appealed to Constantine were Lucian, Dignus,
      Nasutius, Capito, Fidentius and others. There is no Donatus and no
      Majorinus among the five whose names are preserved. St. Optatus
      calls them proleptically the <em>Pars Donati,</em> but the
      <em>Proconsul in his letter to the Emperor</em> called them the
      <em>Pars Maiorini</em> <span>[</span>see Appendix, p.
      421<span>]</span>:. As the name of Majorinus does not occur in the
      first place, he may have just died, and Donatus will have taken
      his place before the ten accusers started for Rome. The Council
      was in that case a trial of the two claimants Donatus and
      Caecilian. The one was acquitted, the other condemned, This is a
      natural sequence.’<a href="#fnref239" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn240"><p>See Appendix, p. 396.<br />
      These words were written by Constantine after the Council of
      Arles. Optatus (who never mentions and probably knew nothing of
      that Council, cf. Appendix, p. 323) inserts them here in error.<a href="#fnref240" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn243"><p><em>in Donatum.</em> Was this Donatus the Great,
      or another Donatus, Bishop of Black Huts <em>(de Casis
      Nigris)</em> in Numidia? It is impossible to answer this question
      with absolute certainty. On the one hand it was assumed by
      Optatus, Augustine and Catholic Apologists generally until the
      Conference in 411 that the Donatus condemned by Pope Miltiades was
      Donatus the Great, the successor of Majorinus as schismatic bishop
      of Carthage. The authority of St. Optatus—so at least it seems to
      me—should go far to settle the controversy, since it is difficult
      to understand how he could well have confused two distinct Bishops
      of the same name one with another. Optatus lived, one would think,
      too near the events which he was chronicling to have made a
      mistake of this character. On the other hand when the Donatists
      protested at the Conference of Carthage that the Donatus condemned
      at Rome was not their protagonist, ‘he who was and still is their
      chief’ (<em>Gesta Coll. Carthag. diei</em> iii, xxxii), but
      another Donatus (‘alium Casae,’ <em>Gesta Coll. Carthag.</em>
      dxxxix, dxl), the Catholics at once admitted that Donatus of Casa
      was clearly designated in the Acts of Miltiades. St. Augustine
      bears witness to this fact, stating that the Catholics granted
      <em>(concedebant)</em> the Donatist contention that ‘it was not
      Donatus the Great but Donatus of Casa who pleaded in the Court of
      Melchiades against Caecilian’ <em>(Brev. coll. diei</em> iii, xx).
      Moreover Augustine writes as follows (<em>Retract.</em> xxi):‘In
      saying that the Donatus whose letter I was answering had asked the
      Emperor to appoint judges from across the seas between him and
      Caecilian I was mistaken, for it was not he but another Donatus
      (who however belonged to the same schism) that will be found more
      probably to have done this. He was not the Donatist Bishop of
      Carthage, but of Black Huts, and was the first to make the wicked
      schism at Carthage.’ Until recently this view reigned practically
      undisputed. Only Albaspinaeus was found to challenge the authority
      of St. Augustine by conjecturing that Majorinus, of whom we never
      hear in connection with the Lateran Synod, was dead at the time
      (this is held to be certain by Dom John Chapman) and that Donatus
      of Black Huts had been elected Bishop in his place. But the very
      existence of a Donatus who was ever Bishop of Black Huts has been
      lately called in question, in the first place by Fr. Chapman, and
      subsequently by others. Thus Mr. Sparrow Simpson writes <em>(St.
      Augustine and African Church Divisions,</em> p. 31), referring to
      Monceaux <em>(Revue de l’Histoire de Religion):</em> ‘it has been
      recently pointed out that the former personage
      <span>[</span>Donatus of Black Huts<span>]</span>: is a highly
      problematical figure. He appears at the Lateran Synod. While he is
      called Bishop of Black Huts in Numidia, he is never heard of as
      residing in his own diocese, but at Carthage. After the Lateran
      Synod he disappears and is replaced by a Donatus who holds
      precisely the same position over the party.’ The theory of
      Albaspinaeus, if adopted, would remove these difficulties, but it
      involves the supposition that there were two Bishops of Carthage,
      immediately following one another and each named Donatus. For this
      supposition there is not a scrap of evidence. Moreover such a
      translation from one See to another as is here supposed would have
      been directly opposed to the Canons in force at the time, and if
      it had been effected would certainly have been one of the staple
      charges against the Donatists. But of this there is not a trace in
      history. Fr. Chapman solves the whole difficulty with the
      simplicity of genius by a reasoned argument (<em>La Revue
      Bénédictine,</em> Janvier 1909) directed to show that Casae Nigrae
      was not the See, but the birthplace, of the Great Donatus. In the
      same article he suggests a most interesting explanation of the
      surprising readiness with which the Catholics at the Conference of
      Carthage admitted the Donatist contention that their eponymous
      champion had not been condemned at Rome. However after all has
      been said, the whole of this matter will remain at least for some
      minds hidden in obscurity, and it is difficult to see from what
      quarter we may look for further light. Meanwhile we must all agree
      with Fr. Chapman that ‘the importation of a Bishop of Casae Nigrae
      only brings confusion into <span>[</span>what would otherwise
      be<span>]</span>: a plain tale.’ I myself think that, were
      Professor Ziwsa still alive, he would gladly bow to Fr. Chapman’s
      authority and arguments and remove the name of Donatus Casensis
      (at least as a person distinct from Donatus Carthaginis) from the
      index to any subsequent edition of his Optatus.<a href="#fnref243" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn245"><p><em>etiam Miltiadis sententia, qua iudicium
      clausum est his verbis.</em> These words of St. Optatus remind us
      of St. Augustine’s famous statement (<em>Serm.</em> cxxxi, 10):
      ‘Already two councils have been sent to the Apostolic See
      concerning this matter <span>[</span>Pelagianism<span>]</span>:,
      and thence have come rescripts. The case is concluded (caussa
      finita est). Would that the error might soon cease also.’ St.
      Augustine’s account of the matter with which St. Optatus is
      concerned in the text is well worth reading, since he (like St.
      Optatus) had documents which have not come down to us: ‘Will you
      urge that Melchiades, Bishop of the Roman Church, with his
      colleagues across the seas was not right in arrogating for his own
      judgement (non debuit . . . sibi usurpare iudicium) a case which
      had been concluded by seventy African Bishops under the presidency
      of the primate of Tigisis? But what if it was not he who arrogated
      it? It was, in fact, because he had been requested, that the
      Emperor sent Bishops to sit with him, and to decide what they
      considered to be just with regard to the whole case. This we prove
      both by the petition of the Donatists and by the Emperor’s own
      words; for you will remember that both these documents were read
      to you, and you have now permission to inspect them and copy them
      out’ (<em>Ep.</em> xliii, 5, 14). (See Appendix for the Emperor’s
      letters.) St. Augustine is not, of course, suggesting that the
      Pope had no right to judge the affair, any more than he is
      implying that the Emperor had a right to appoint judges. The
      argument is strictly <em>ad hominem.</em> The Donatists could not
      complain that Melchiades had no right to reverse the judgement of
      seventy Numidian Bishops, since they had themselves appealed to
      the Emperor to appoint Bishops to judge the matter anew. They
      admitted, therefore, that the Numidian judgement was not
      irreformable. Further on in the same letter St. Augustine
      continues: ‘And yet what a final sentence that was which the
      blessed Melchiades himself pronounced, how innocent, how honest,
      how far-sighted and peace-loving, in that he did not venture to
      remove from their position in the episcopal fellowship those
      colleagues against whom nothing had been proved, whilst he laid
      the chief blame upon Donatus alone (whom he had discovered to be
      the author of all the evil), but gave the free option of
      recovering communion to the rest, since he was ready to issue
      letters of communion even to those who were known to have been
      ordained by Majorinus, in such wise that, wherever, on account of
      the dissension between the two parties, there were two rival
      Bishops, the one who had been first ordained should be confirmed
      in his see, and the other should be provided with another diocese.
      O admirable man, O son of Christian peace, and father of the
      Christian people’ (<em>Ep.</em> xiii, 5. 16). We may observe that
      from this time forward the Popes issued their decretal letters
      from a small council of Bishops.<a href="#fnref245" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      (<em>a</em>)<em></em> <span>[</span>ἡ καθολικὴ
      Ἐκκλησία<span>]</span>:{.Greek} or <em>Ecclesia Calholica</em>
      almost always means, in the Fathers, the Church militant on earth
      at the time when they wrote. Thus even at the beginning of the
      second century the word Catholic is used by St. Ignatius <em>(Ep.
      ad Smyrn.</em> 8) for the true Church throughout the world, in
      contrast with heretical sects. It is also found four times in
      <em>The Letter of the Church of Smyrna on the Martyrdom of the
      holy Polycarp:</em> <span>[</span>Τῆς ἁγίας καὶ καθολικῆς
      Ἐκκλησίας<span>]</span>:{.Greek} <em>(ad init.)</em>;
      <span>[</span>Τῆς κατὰ τὴν οἰκουμένην καθολικῆς
      Ἐκκλησίας<span>]</span>:{.Greek} (viii, xix); <span>[</span>Τῆς ἐν
      Σμύρνῃ καθολικῆς
      Ἐκκλεσίας<span>]</span>:{.Greek<span>]</span><br />
      (<em>b</em>)<em></em> The word ‘Church’ is sometimes used in
      another sense to denote the Church on earth in all times and
      places, and the epithet Catholic is still strictly in place. For
      example, later in the second century St. Clement of Alexandria
      wrote as follows <em>(Strom.</em> VII, xvii, 106, 107):—‘It needs
      no long discourse to prove that the merely human assemblies which
      they have instituted were later in time than the Catholic Church.
      . . . We say then that the ancient and Catholic Church stands
      alone . . . gathering together into the unity of the One Faith,
      built upon the fitting covenants or rather upon the one Covenant
      given at different times, all those who have been already therein
      enrolled’ etc.<br />
      (<em>c</em>) The Church is also said to include not only her
      children on earth, but also the holy dead. Thus St. Augustine
      (<em>De Civ. Dei</em> xx, 9): ‘Neither are the souls of the holy
      dead separated from the Church, which even now is the Kingdom of
      Christ.’ In this most comprehensive sense the epithet Catholic is
      rarely (if ever) applied to the word ‘Church.’ Should any case
      perchance exist where a Father so employs the word
      <em>Catholic,</em> it would be ‘less properly’ (as opposed to the
      general patristic usage)—in the sense that the Blessed souls in
      Heaven and in Purgatory belonged to the Catholic Church when they
      were living on earth. It seems well to note this, because there
      has sometimes been confusion on the point amongst Non-Catholic
      writers. For example Dr. Darwell Stone (<em>The Christian
      Church</em> p. 214) philosophises concerning ‘two ideas of the
      unity of the Church which St. Augustine failed to reconcile,’ and
      boldly writes as follows: ‘that notion of the nature and unity of
      the Church which may be illustrated from Clement of Alexandria and
      from Origen, but also from St. Augustine, which lays stress on the
      union of the church militant with the departed and with those yet
      unborn, and which finds points of contact amongst living
      Christians in the unseen realities, is not really allowed for in
      the Roman Catholic doctrine.’ Of course it is pure imagination to
      fancy that there were two opposing views in the minds of the
      Fathers, striving for the mastery, which ‘Augustine failed to
      reconcile,’ but which eventually emerged the one in
      ‘Ultramontanism,’ the other in some such system as Anglicanism.
      But there <em>are</em> two ways of looking at the Church, as we
      regard it from different aspects. We find both of these, as we
      should naturally expect, in the Fathers. There is the ordinary
      patristic view, with which St. Optatus for example makes us so
      familiar, of one Body upon earth, not merely local, but scattered
      throughout the world, with its members all joined together, one
      with each other, in an actual, visible, external communion. (This
      on Anglican theories is admittedly not a necessity, but only a
      desirable dream-picture.) There is also, no doubt, to be found in
      the Fathers a conception of the Church as an ideal unity of all
      the redeemed on earth and in heaven, united by the mystical
      indwelling of the Holy Spirit. But far from these being mutually
      exclusive views between which the Fathers oscillate, they are two
      different entities, each of which represents a great reality, not
      merely ‘allowed for,’ but much more—apprehended by ‘the Roman
      Catholic ’as keenly now as in any age of the Church’s history. The
      latter of these, however, is not what the Fathers mean by ’the
      Catholic Church,’ but <em>is</em> the whole Church of the
      Redeemed—whose ‘names are written in heaven’—now <em>in
      fieri,</em> only to be realised at the Last Day. The former is the
      Church militant, <em>the Catholic Church,</em> diffused throughout
      the world (as its name implies) <em>and nowhere else.</em> It is
      of this visible Catholic Church that the Fathers predicate unity,
      not merely as a quality, but as an essential quality, and a
      visible ‘note’ or characteristic by which (in conjunction with her
      existence everywhere, or her Catholicity) she is to be instantly
      recognised. This is the meaning of the definition of Eunomius and
      Olimpius (as given by St. Optatus), which cut at the root of the
      Donatist question. On the one side stood a great number of African
      bishops. On the other side was Caecilian with (probably) but few
      colleagues in Africa, but in communion with all the rest of the
      Catholic world. So seventy African Bishops, even with the Primate
      Secundus, were of no importance, for over against them was ‘the
      Catholic Church.’ It is exactly the same touchstone as St. Cyril
      of Jerusalem had given when he told his hearers to ask in every
      city not for the kuriakh&amp; (the house of God, or Church), but
      for ‘the Catholic Church,’—the same touchstone that St. Pacian
      gave against the Novatians, when he said ‘Christian is my name,
      Catholic is my surname.’ <em>The visible unity of one visible
      Church throughout the world</em> is the presupposition and the
      teaching of all the Fathers. This is seen perhaps with special
      clearness in this Donatist controversy. But at all times and
      everywhere the patristic conception of the Church and of Schism
      is, apart from this presupposition, wholly unintelligible.<br />
      (<em>d</em>) There is yet another distinction made by St.
      Augustine against the Donatists between the Catholic Church on
      earth, in which good and evil men are living together, and the
      Church of the Saints after the General Judgement. It is, he
      writes, One Holy Church, but after a different fashion
      (<em>aliter</em>). The state of the Church <em>now</em> was
      typified by the miraculous draught of fishes before the
      Resurrection when the nets were cast on the left hand as well as
      on the right—and were broken; the state of the Church
      <em>hereafter</em> by the draught after the Resurrection, when the
      nets were cast only on the right side—and remained unbroken. (Cf.
      <em>Brev. Coll.</em> iii, 9, 10.)<a href="#fnref254" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn255"><p>St. Augustine (<em>con. Epist. Parmen.</em> iii,
      3) summed up the decision of Eunomius and Olimpius in the
      celebrated words: ‘Quapropter securus iudicat orbis terrarum bonos
      non esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quacunque parte orbis
      terrarum.’ ‘Wherefore the <span>[</span>Catholic<span>]</span>:
      world judges without anxiety that they are not good who in any
      part of the world separate themselves from the

      Melchiadis Romani Episcopi et aliorum cum illo Gallorum et
      Italorum Episcoporum in eadem Urbe Roma factum, cuius iudicii

      Caeciliani, qui missi fuerant, negaverunt se habere quod in eum

      est, adhuc diacono Caeciliano <span>[</span>that is in the days of
      Mensurius, when Donatus the Great was probably, like Caecilian,

      fecisse Carthagine: de Carthaginis enim scismate exorta est
      adversus Ecclesiam pars Donati.’ From this we learn that the Acts
      of the first session of the Lateran Synod were read at the
      Conference of 411, but here once more we have to deplore the loss

      and many other sectaries, prided themselves (without the slightest
      justification in fact) upon their sanctity. According to their
      teaching, the true Church was to be exclusively the Church of ‘the
      Saints.’ There were to be no unclean beasts in the Ark of Noah.
      The tares were not to be allowed to grow up with the wheat unto
      the harvest; nor were the bad fish to remain with the good in
      Peter’s net. Furthermore, they made the validity of the sacraments

      <li id="fn269"><p>Evidently the idea of Comprehensiveness—that the
      One Church could be Catholic (Universal)—in the sense of
      comprehending various kinds of religious bodies, varying in belief
      and without any external bond of union (cf. ii, 3)—never occurred
      to St. Optatus even as a possibility. Any ‘branch’ theory in which
      the branches were separated from the trunk or from one another
      (cf. ii, 9 etc.) would have seemed to him unthinkable. He agrees
      with Parmenian in ruling it out <em>ab initio.</em><a href="#fnref269" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn271"><p>In some of the countries mentioned by Optatus as
      belonging to the Catholic Unity, Christianity has almost
      disappeared as an energising force. Others of those lands, such as
      ‘Thrace, Achaia, Macedonia, and all Greece,’ are now unhappily in
      schism. Still, his argument has been enormously strengthened by
      the lapse of centuries. The Catholic of to-day is in full
      communion not only, as was St. Optatus, with the See of Rome where
      Peter sat, with the See of Lyons where Irenaeus sat, with the See
      of Barcelona where Pacian sat, with the See of Tours where Martin
      sat, with the See of Verona where Zeno sat, with the See of Milan
      where Ambrose was soon to sit, with the direct successors of
      ‘Maternus from the city of Cologne, of Reticius from the city of
      Autun, of Marinus of Aries, of Felix from Florence of the Tuscans,
      of Gaudentius of Pisa, of Proterius of Capua,’ and of every other
      of the nineteen Bishops who sat in the Synod of the Lateran with
      Miltiades the Pope (i, 23)—this is surely a great and striking
      thing—but also with Churches of which Optatus never dreamed, in
      islands and continents of which he had never heard.<a href="#fnref271" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn273"><p><em>rationabilis et ubique diffusa.</em> Thus in
      all the MSS. Two emendations have been suggested, <em>Non
      nationalis et</em> &amp;c, and <em>Rationabiliter ubique
      diffusa.</em> Probably, however, St. Optatus wrote it as we find
      it in the MSS., <em>Rationabilis et ubique diffusa.</em> If so,
      through his ignorance of Greek, he is linking together two
      different derivations of the word <span>καθολικός</span><em>.</em>
      From <span>κατὰ</span> and <span>ὅλον</span>, <em>= ‘throughout
      the whole’</em> (i.e. scattered throughout the world), and from
      <span>κατὰ</span> and <span>λόγον</span> = ‘in accordance with
      reason.’ We know that, in consequence of this last meaning of the
      word, Procurators fiscal in Roman law were often called
      <em>Rationales</em> or <span>καθολικοί</span>. St. Optatus was
      probably in his first derivation thinking of heretics, in his
      second of schismatics. The Church is Catholic or
      <em>rationabilis</em> (according to right reason) in
      contradistinction to <em>heretics,</em> who have strayed from the
      truth (against the due exercise of their reason); she is Catholic
      or <em>ubique diffusa</em> (spread everywhere) in
      contradistinction to schismatics, who are confined within clearly
      defined, very often within national, bounds and limits. Cf. St.

      world); yet, like the Donatists again, the ‘Orthodox’ claim to be

      separated from the Catholic Church —even less the non-Christian
      world—but the Catholic world. The Catholic world is the Judge, and
      judges free from anxiety, for this very reason that it

      <li id="fn292"><p>St. Optatus has given us a summary proof that
      the Catholic Church is not merely local, but claims to be
      everywhere. He proceeds, in answer to Parmenian, to discuss the
      Adornments <em>(Ornamenta)</em> or Endowments <em>(Dotes)</em> of
      the Church. The figure is that of a Dowry bestowed by our Lord
      upon His Bride, the Church. There is no other reference to these
      <em>Dotes</em> in patristic literature.<a href="#fnref292" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn293"><p>It is not difficult to reconstruct Parmenian’s
      argument from the pages of Optatus. We see that Parmenian had
      argued that the Endowments were six in number, and had maintained
      that they were all distinctive of Donatism and lacking to the
      Catholic Church.<br />
      (1) <em>Cathedra</em> (the expression for See so well known in
      Africa from the writings of St. Cyprian).<br />
      (2) <em>Angelus</em> (from Apoc. ii, 3).<br />
      (3) <em>Spiritus.</em><br />
      (4) <em>Fons signatus</em> (from Cant. iv, 1).<br />
      (5) <em>Sigillum</em> (quo fons signatur).<br />
      (6) <em>Umbilicus</em> (from Cant. vii, 2).<br />
      It was common ground between Optatus and his opponent that the
      <em>hortus conclusus</em> (enclosed garden) of Cant. iv, 12-13 (’
      Hortus conclusus mea sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus,
      emissiones tuae paradisus’) signified the Church (cf. ii, 11:
      ‘Quod <em>ore tuo et sensu nostro</em> ecclesiam paradisum esse
      dixisti’). Accordingly the <em>fons signatus</em> (sealed
      fountain) is the <em>baptismal font,</em> which (according to
      Parmenian) is sealed to all outside the true Church, so that
      Baptism by schismatics as well as by heretics is invalid. The
      <em>sigillum</em> (seal) is the baptismal creed.<br />
      The font is only made a saving fountain, if it is blessed by the
      true Bishop or <em>angelus.</em> Only thus is the third Endowment,
      the <em>Spirit,</em> in the water of Baptism. Parmenian proves
      this by quoting John v, 4, whence St. Optatus’ words (ii, 6):
      ‘Unde vobis angelum, qui apud vos possit fontem movere aut inter
      ceteras dotes Ecclesiae numerari?’ We see that Parmenian had
      evidently taken the ‘Angel’ in the Apocalypse (without identifying
      him with any particular Bishop) in order to prove that only a true
      Bishop was able so ‘to move the water,’ that the Spirit should be
      there for valid Baptism. By <em>Umbilicus</em> Parmenian
      understood the altar. We can thus follow what no doubt was his
      argument. ‘The true Church has,’ he will have said to the
      Catholics, ‘six Endowments.’ (1) <em>Cathedra,</em> a lawful right
      to the See. But Caecilian had no such right, for the Numidian
      Bishops were not called to his election, and a Council of seventy
      Bishops deposed him. (2) <em>Angelus,</em> or a Bishop sent by
      God, but Caecilian was ordained by a <em>Traditor.</em> (3)
      <em>Spiritus,</em> the Spirit of adoption, who makes sons of God
      in Baptism. (4) This Spirit will only work by means of the water
      in the <em>Fons,</em> which is moved by the <em>Angelus.</em>
      Hence all those persons who have been baptised by others than
      Donatists must be rebaptised. (5) For the Fountain is <em>signatus
      sigillo</em> (Symboli) ,and all but Donatists are heretical. (6)
      And the <em>Umbilicus</em> (altar) must also belong to the true
      <em>Angelus.</em> On this pretext they scraped, broke down and
      even utterly destroyed Catholic altars (cf. vi, 1). Such is the
      argument that St. Optatus had to meet. He denied (on what seems to
      us to be a technicality only) that <em>Umbilicus</em> was one of
      these Endowments, but proceeded (2-9) to argue against Parmenian
      that the first five belonged to Catholics, and were marks of the
      Catholic Church exclusively, and in no way shared by the
      Donatists. In the first place, he takes <em>Cathedra</em> and
      <em>Angelus</em> together, and shows that the Donatists could have
      neither the one nor the other unless they were in union with the
      See of Peter. For the <em>Cathedra Petri</em> pre-eminently is
      <em>the</em> Cathedra.<a href="#fnref293" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn294"><p>St. Cyprian was the first Father to use the term
      <em>Cathedra</em> (Chair). He applied it (as a word in common use
      at the time) to the See of Rome which he termed the <em>Cathedra
      Petri.</em> Parmenian, evidently, had claimed the
      <em>Cathedra,</em> stating that it belonged to him through the
      <em>Angelus</em> or Bishop (in other words ‘We have valid Orders,
      and therefore we are in the Church’). St. Optatus replies to this
      in the text by making direct appeal to Rome. No man can possess a
      <em>Cathedra,</em> argues Optatus, who is not in communion with
      the one <em>Cathedra,</em> which, in all but successive sentences,
      he calls ‘una Cathedra,’ ‘singularis Cathedra’ and ‘Cathedra
      unica.’ Balduinus, in the course of a long letter which he
      addressed to Calvin on the occasion of bringing out his first
      edition of Optatus, remarked as follows: ‘Locutus est, ut scis,
      Christus de iis, qui sedent in Cathedra Mosis; veteres Christiani

      an Aramaic from a Greek word that Balduinus thinks that <em>Unde
      et Cephas appellatus est</em> was not written by St. Optatus, but
      was introduced by some librarian from a marginal note of an
      ignorant commentator. But we must remember that neither Optatus
      nor any of the ancients knew anything of etymology. In vii, 3, St.
      Optatus simply calls St. Peter <em>Caput Apostolorum,</em> without
      any further comment.<a href="#fnref302" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn303"><p><em>in qua unica Cathedra unitas ab omnibus

      expressed by St. Cyprian, cf. e.g. ‘Una ecclesia a Christo Domino
      nostro super Petrum, origine unitatis et ratione fundata’
      (<em>Ep.</em> lxx, 3), and ‘Petro primum Dominus, super quern
      aedificavit Ecclesiam, et unde unitatis originem instituit et
      ostendit, potestatem istam dedit’ (<em>Ep.</em> lxxiii, 3), and
      ‘Deus unus est et Christus unus, et una Ecclesia, et <em>Cathedra
      una,</em> super Petrum Domini voce fundata’ (xliii, 5). We should
      always bear in mind that St. Cyprian was at this time the great
      authority in Christian Africa, not only in the eyes of Catholics,
      but also in those of Donatists. Thus St. Augustine writes
      (<em>Brev. Coll.</em> iii, 10): ‘Repetierunt Catholici testimonium
      Cypriani . . . Contra quod testimonium omnino nihil ausi fuerunt
      respondere, cum auctoritatem Cypriani tanti habeant, ut per illam
      conentur defendere, quod male de iterando Baptismo sentiunt et

      defenderent, ut iam scismaticus et peccator esset, qui contra
      singularem Cathedram alteram conlocaret.</em> This perfectly plain
      doctrine of St. Optatus was never once challenged amongst
      Christians (the Albigenses were Manichees rather than Christians)
      until the days of Hus and Wycliffe, some nine hundred years later.
      We know that the work of St. Optatus was the great authority and
      handbook of St. Augustine in his arguments against the Donatists.
      He constantly echoes the teaching of St. Optatus, concerning the
      Chair of Peter, and, in his controversy with the Donatists,
      applied the famous promise ‘Upon this Rock I will build my Church’
      to this Holy See. ‘Sedes Petri . . . ipsa est Petra’ <em>(Ps. con.
      Donat.</em> St. xiv). Dr. Sparrow Simpson, however, writes as
      follows with reference to this passage of St. Optatus: ‘Optatus
      illustrates this succession from the case of Rome, because St.
      Peter as the chief Apostle, represents the principle of unity. No
      Apostle was to arrogate to himself the Apostolic powers <em>in
      separation from the other Apostles</em>’ (<em>St. Augustine and
      African Church Divisions,</em> Chapter on St. Optatus’ Reply to
      the Donatists, p. 45). Unfortunately for Dr. Sparrow Simpson’s
      accuracy, St. Optatus has not (either here or elsewhere) written
      one syllable about ‘no Apostle’ separating from ‘the other
      Apostles.’ He has, however, explained (vii, 3) that the Apostles
      were not free, on account of Peter’s denial of Christ, to separate
      from the one Apostle ‘who alone received the Keys of the Kingdom
      of Heaven, to be shared with the rest.’ He has also written with
      all possible emphasis concerning the unlawfulness of separating
      from the <em>Cathedra Petri,</em> which he here calls ‘the unique
      Cathedra.’ Of all this, we regret to say that Dr. Sparrow Simpson
      gives not even a hint in his in some respects useful analysis of
      the argument of Optatus.<a href="#fnref304" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Caecilian and Restitutus (the Catholic Bishops) on the one hand,
      or by Majorinus and Parmenian (the Donatists) on the other—a
      matter which has already been discussed in i, 10. <em>The present
      question is what have the Donatists to set against the Unica ac

      present division into chapters) by suggesting that they might
      allege <em>their Bishops of Rome. ’But</em> you allege, etc’ St.

      Anti-Popes, consecrating a Bishop for the purpose and sending him
      to Rome, to preside over their handful of adherents in the City.
      He writes as follows: ‘The connection with Peter’s Chair was of
      decisive importance, not only for Optatus, but also for his
      opponent, who had appealed to the fact that the Donatists had also
      a Bishop in Rome’ (Harnack, <em>History of Dogma,</em> v, 155).<a href="#fnref313" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Albaspinaeus translates <em>Relics.</em> But <em>Memoria</em> is a
      chapel or church built over the body of a Saint. Here it refers to
      the Basilica built by Constantine and destroyed in the sixteenth
      century, where Macrobius could naturally not say Mass. Over the
      body of St. Paul a small Basilica was erected by Constantine. The
      great church, burnt in 1826, was built in the fifth century, later
      than St. Optatus (cf. <em>Condi. Carthag.</em> 14: ‘altaria, quae
      . . . tanquam <em>Memoriae</em> martyrum constituuntur’).<a href="#fnref315" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn316"><p><em>Memoriis Sanctorum communicantes</em>. The
      reference is to Romans xii, 13. It is quite unintelligible to us
      until we learn that some ancient MSS. had <span>ταῖς
      μνείαις</span> instead of <span>ταῖς χρείαις</span>. The reading
      <span>μνείαις</span> is in the Acts of Pionius (second or third
      century) and in the bilingual codices D and G; it was therefore
      the Western and Old Latin reading. It is used, amongst others, by
      St. Hilary, Ambrosiaster, St. Peter Chrysologus and St. Gregory
      the Great, who writes <em>(De Verbis Domini</em> exxxvii. 3, 7,
      last chapter): ‘<em>Communicatio Memoriis</em> sanctorum
      martyrum.’ Both readings were known to Chrysostom, Theodore of
      Mopsuestia, Jerome, Rufinus, Augustine and Pelagius. So we see
      that in following this reading St. Optatus does not stand alone.

      <li id="fn355"><p><em>qui apud vos possit fontem movere</em>—i.e.
      ‘A Bishop able to give grace.’ The reference is to John v, 4. It
      is interesting to see that this text was in the Version used by
      Parmenian.<a href="#fnref355" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn356"><p><em>extra Septem Ecclesias quicquid foris est
      alienum est.</em> (Cf. vi, 3: ‘Orientalibus . . . ubi est
      septiformis Ecclesia.’) Here, as elsewhere, St. Optatus supposes
      St. Cyprian to be familiar to his readers. St. Cyprian teaches
      that the Seven Macchabees are the type of the several churches,
      children of one Mother, and that on this account both St. Paul and
      St. John wrote to <em>seven</em> churches. (See <em>Ad
      Fortunatum</em> cap. xi. and <em>Testimonies</em> i, 20.) On the
      one hand St. Optatus never expected the Seven Churches of Asia to
      be overrun by the Turk, but on the other hand it is not likely
      that he supposed them to be infallible or indefectible, for the
      heresies in some had been sufficiently notorious. But he took the
      seven apostolic churches then existing in Asia as a real proof of
      Apostolicity, for one reason because Parmenian evidently had
      referred to them by mentioning the <em>Angel</em> as one of the
      Endowments. St. Optatus retorts, ‘We are actually in communion
      with these Seven Churches, but you are not!’ Whatever is without
      the Seven Churches (not, I think, necessarily <em>these
      particular</em> seven churches mentioned in the Apocalypse, for if
      Optatus had wished to say this, he would, as elsewhere, have
      written ‘extra <em>quas</em> septem Ecclesias,’ (cf. ‘ad
      <em>quorum</em> Ecclesias,’ ‘cum <em>quibus</em> Ecclesiis,’ etc.,
      <em>supra,)</em> but whatever is without Cyprian’s mystical Seven)
      is outside <em>(foris),</em> is alien <em>(alienum).</em> In all
      probability <em>foris</em> and <em>alienum</em> are used as
      synonyms (see i, 11,’ dum foras exeunt et se separant’; so
      Cyprian, <em>Ep. ad Anton.</em> i, 8, writes of a schismatic
      Bishop ‘profanus est, <em>alienus</em> est, <em>foris</em> est’),
      though Ziwsa says that <em>alienum</em> here = <em>diversum.</em>
      Optatus has already written (i, 12) that heretics are ‘ab hortulo
      et a paradiso Dei alieni’; he now writes simply that’ whatever is
      schismatic’ is ‘<em>alienum’</em>—is alien, is foreign to, is not
      within ’God’s garden’—the Catholic Church. (We may compare St.
      Ambrose in <em>Ep.</em> I. <em>Ad Cor.</em> iii, 15, ‘Extra
      Catholicam quicquid est, contrarium est.’) St. Augustine takes up
      and several times uses this appeal to the Apostolic churches of
      the East. It is sometimes compared by non-Catholic
      controversialists to the patristic appeal to communion with Rome.
      But the work of St. Optatus is by itself enough to show the lack
      of parity. The duty of union with the Cathedra Petri is put
      forward as of primary and absolute necessity, because it is
      <em>the</em> Cathedra, because Peter alone received the keys, and
      the like. There are no parallel statements—evidently none could be
      made—in any of the Fathers about any other See, save the See of
      Rome. A Catholic in England before the Reformation might have said
      with perfect truth: ‘Whoever is not in communion with the See of
      Canterbury is outside the Church’; as a Catholic to-day may say
      with equal truth: ‘Whoever is not in communion with the See of
      Westminster is outside the Church.’ It in no wise follows that the
      See of Canterbury has not fallen, nor that the See of Westminster
      may not <em>(quod avertat Deus)</em> fall into schism. Such
      immunity from schism and heresy can be predicated of One See
      alone—itself the Centre of Unity—set up for this very purpose,
      ‘that unity might be preserved by all’—the <em>Cathedra
      Singularis</em> of St. Optatus (cf. note 2, p. 67).<a href="#fnref356" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn357"><p><em>et per angelos supra memoratis ecclesiis et
      per ipsas Ecclesias nobis.</em> As Optatus proceeds immediately to
      urge, it is an incontrovertible principle of Catholicism that he
      who is in communion with one member of the Body is thereby
      <em>ipso facto</em> in communion with the other members, and with
      the whole Body; whereas he who is out of communion with one member
      is out of communion with all. The test is of easy application, and
      is most often made (as Optatus made it) primarily in relation to
      the See of Peter, but we may apply it with equal certainty to any
      See which <em>without controversy</em> belongs to the Catholic
      Church. Thus St. Optatus applied it to the Seven Churches
      mentioned in the Apocalypse. We can apply it, say, to the Church
      of Madrid, concerning which there can be no doubt that it is
      Catholic. So, if any man (or any organised religious body) claims
      to be Catholic, we may ask at once: ‘Are you in communion with the
      Bishop of Madrid? If so, through the Bishop of Madrid, you are in
      communion with the whole Catholic Church, and since we (whom
      perhaps you call “Roman Catholics”) are in communion with the
      Bishop of Madrid, you must also be in communion with us—which is
      manifestly untrue and—unless you too are in communion with
      Rome—ridiculous. But if you are not in communion with the Bishop
      of Madrid (who is, as you freely acknowledge, a Catholic Bishop),
      you are thereby convicted of being outside the Church, and are not
      a Catholic, whatever you may be pleased to call yourself.’ This is
      the argument of St. Optatus, and of Catholics generally in every
      age. It at once makes the question of the validity of Orders
      irrelevant to the main issue, and raises the discussion to a
      higher plane—to the analogy of the mystical Body of Christ with a
      human body, in which, so long as the eye (or any other member) is
      in union with the hand (provided only that the hand is in union
      with the heart), both live; but the moment that separation comes,
      one, or both, must be out of the body.<a href="#fnref357" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn358"><p>‘If you are not in communion with any Catholic
      Bishops your position is hopeless; but if you are in communion
      with any Catholic Bishops you must through them be in communion
      with us, for we are in communion with them.’ (This is, of course;
      the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of which we have spoken in the
      preceding note.) ‘But if you are in communion with us, you cannot
      have any longer any case against us. You have lost your case.’ It
      is possible that by <em>Angelus,</em> St. Optatus does not in this
      passage understand the Bishop himself, but the Guardian Angel of
      the Church, who attends upon the Bishop. In this case his argument
      will be precisely the same: ‘If you have an Angel shut up in a
      box, send him to Asia, and tell him to treat the Apostolic
      Churches there as excluded from the true Church,and to cut off
      their Angels, to whom St. John wrote, from his communion. Your
      Angel, if you have one, will not do that. So if you are not in
      communion with those Angels, how can you have an Angel at all? Are
      not all the Angels in communion with one another? And the Seven
      Churches are a type of the whole Church. Conversely, if you have
      an Angel, he must be in communion with the other Angels and
      therefore with those Apostolic Churches, and (as we are in
      communion with them) then you must be in communion with us, and so
      your whole attack upon us breaks down.’ Whether <em>Angelus</em>
      means Angel or Bishop, the argument is the same, and clear.<a href="#fnref358" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      the first. That Church which has the <em>Cathedra</em> has them
      all, and is proved by this very fact—through union with the Chair
      of Peter—to have the others also (ii, 5-6). As is obvious, Optatus
      was precluded by his statement that the Donatists were schismatics
      and not heretics from proving <em>directly</em> that they are
      without the fourth and fifth Endowments. Therefore he contents
      himself with having already proved it indirectly and inferentially
      by his statement that, since they have not the first Endowment,
      they cannot have the rest, and merely agrees with them that they

      <li id="fn374"><p>St. Optatus looked upon these Endowments as
      something external to the Body of Christ. He regarded what we now
      call the Notes, or Marks, of the Church as two. The true Church is
      <em>One</em> and <em>Catholic</em> (of world-wide extension). When
      the Church of Christ has been thus identified, as the Church which
      is One and is Everywhere (<em>ubique),</em> Optatus agrees with
      Parmenian as to her five Endowments, but explains them very
      differently. According to the mind of Optatus they are: (1) First
      and foremost—Union with the Chair of Peter <em>(Cathedra);</em>
      (2) Apostolic Succession <em>(Angelus);</em> (3) The Spirit of
      sonship <em>(Spiritus);</em> (4) The Baptismal Font, or perhaps
      the True Faith <em>(Fons);</em> (5) The Seal of the Faith—the
      Creed <em>(Sigillum).</em> These Endowments are distinctive and
      characteristic of Catholicism. They are gifts from God <em>ab
      extra</em> bestowed upon His Bride the Church. It can be proved
      to-day that the One Church, which is not merely local, but is
      scattered through all the nations, still possesses these
      ‘Endowments,’ e.g. is still in union with the See of Peter
      (‘Cathedra Petri quae nostra est’; cf. note 2, p. 86). On the
      other hand, it will be seen immediately that any religious body
      out of communion with the Catholic Church is without one at least
      of these Endowments, e.g. has not the Cathedra Petri, from which
      unhappily it is severed.<a href="#fnref374" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      ordain validly. As a result they dared to deny that the Eucharist
      consecrated by Catholics was the Body of Christ, and were even
      guilty of the horrible sacrilege of casting It to dogs (cf. ii,

      Persona. Persona</em> means first a mask, and thence a
      representative. There can be no doubt that St. Optatus is here
      referring to St. Peter, or his successor in the See of Rome, as
      the Representative of the Church. This is made clear by the fact
      that he is giving a summary of the arguments which he has already
      brought forward in his book. Now amongst these arguments the
      representative character of St. Peter and of his <em>Cathedra</em>
      has, as we have just seen, taken a leading place. Again, no
      alternative explanation of <em>Persona</em> in this passage has
      ever been suggested. Further, it is well known that St. Augustine
      adopted this traditional view, and in several passages has written
      of St. Peter as representing the whole Catholic Church in his own
      person: e.g. Gestat enim Petrus <em>Ecclesiae</em> plerumque
      <em>personam (Sermo de Verb. Evangel. Matt.</em> lxxiv. 10);
      Petrus a petra cognominatus beatus, <em>Ecclesiae figuram</em>
      portans, apostolatus principatum tenens etc. (<em>Sermo</em>
      lxxvi. ut supra); Petrus in multis locis Scripturarum apparet quod
      <em>personam</em> gestet <em>Ecclesiae (Sermo</em> cxlix. 7 <em>de
      Verbis Act.</em> cap. x); Nam et ipsum Petrum, cui commendavit
      oves suas quasi alter alteri, unum Secum facere volebat, ut sic ei
      oves commendaret, <em>ut esset Ille Caput, ille figuram Corporis
      portaret, id est, Ecclesiae,</em> et tanquam sponsus et sponsa

      the others—the local Bishop, the Holy Spirit, the Faith and the
      Creed) wherever she may be, in whatever part of the world. This
      See is the first and typical See, with which all Catholic Bishops
      are in communion</em> ubique.* It was idle then for Parmenian to
      appeal to <em>his</em> Cathedra. It was not the ’Cathedra unica’;
      it was not</em> ubique.* If in all parts of the world there are
      <em>Cathedras,</em> if Italy and Asia have succession of Bishops
      as well as Africa, and if in Africa there are now rival
      <em>Cathedras,</em> the question arises: ‘Which is the true
      Cathedra? Where is the true Church?’ To this Optatus gives the
      answer: That is the true Cathedra in every place on which is
      seated a Bishop in communion with the original Cathedra at Rome;
      there also is the true Church, for ‘the Catholic Church is the

      <em>(De pecc. origin.</em> ii, 40; cf. <em>con. Iul. Pelag.</em>
      iii, 5) observes that in the Baptism of children the Pelagians
      replied to the question, ‘<em>abrenuntias Satanae?’,</em> though
      they denied that these children were subject to original sin.
      Similarly, St. Cyprian <em>(Ep. ad Magnum</em> 7) tells us that
      the Novatians did not venture to pass over in Baptism the solemn
      words,’<em>credis remissionem peccatorum?‘,* and continued
      thus,’</em>et vitam aeternam per Sanctam Ecclesiam?‘;* yet they
      believed not in the Forgiveness of Sins and did not belong to the
      Holy Church. Throughout history we find heretics employing
      venerable creeds and solemn prayers, the sense of which they have,
      often long since, abjured. Thus St. Augustine <em>(De dono
      Persev.</em> xiii, 33) turned their use of the Preface in the Mass
      against the Pelagians in these words: ’Quod ergo in Sacramentis
      Fidelium dicitur, ut sursum habeamus corda ad Dominum, munus est
      Domini; de quo munere ipsi Domino Deo nostro gratias agere a
      sacerdote post hanc vocem, quibus hoc dicitur, admonentur, et

      <li id="fn434"><p><em>Sancti Corporis reos</em> (cf. 1 Cor. xi,
      27). Mr. Sparrow Simpson, giving a summary account of this passage
      in Optatus, observes (<em>op. cit.</em> p. 39): ‘The consecrated
      elements from the altars were flung to the dogs.’ St. Optatus
      writes nothing concerning ‘the consecrated elements.’ The very
      word ‘elements’ would, have been incomprehensible to him in this
      connection. He <em>does</em> call the Eucharist ‘the Holy Body’
      and ‘the Body of Christ’ (<em>Corpus Christi,</em> vi, 1). It is
      impossible to avoid observing the contrast between Catholic
      terminology of the fourth, and Anglican terminology of the
      twentieth, century.<a href="#fnref434" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn435"><p>We must not forget that Optatus was an
      eye-witness of many of the scenes which he describes. He does not,
      however, wish to suggest that the angel’s hand was seen, but
      simply to recall the fact that the vessel containing the Holy
      Chrism was uninjured by its fall. This he ascribes to the
      interposition of God, who uses His Angels to guard that which is
      His own, and to minister to the needs of His servants on earth.
      Mr. Sparrow Simpson <em>(id.)</em> comments on these events as
      follows: ‘By these fanatical measures’ <span>[</span><em>sic:</em>
      one of which was throwing the Eucharist to dogs—the ‘facinus
      inmane’ of Optatus<span>]</span> ‘the Separatists relieved their
      feelings <span>[</span><em>sic</em><span>]</span> and expressed
      their contempt. Various strange and legendary incidents recall the
      scandal to the Catholic sense of reverence.’ History sometimes
      repeats herself with minute similarities. In Green’s <em>History
      of the English People</em> (vol. ii, p. 186) we read that in the
      year 1539 ‘In one church a Protestant lawyer raised a dog in his

      (cf. Tixeront, <em>Histoire des dogmes,</em> ii, 282). But we may
      be sure that he did not forget Philippians ii, 13: ‘For it is God,
      who works in you both to will, and to make perfect.’ St. John
      Chrysostom, who of course had never heard of Pelagianism, but was
      much concerned with the defence of free will against Manichaeism,
      uses such expressions as: ‘We must first choose what is right and
      then God will do His part’ (cf. <em>Hom. in Matt.</em> lxix, 2;
      <em>et in Matt.</em> xxxix, 4)—a phrase which St. Augustine would

      <li id="fn469"><p><em>ubi vobis mandatum est radere capita
      sacerdotum?</em> This is really important. From this passage in
      Optatus it is plain that the Donatist sacrilege was no other than
      the wrongful use of the Rite of Degradation as it is now
      prescribed in the Roman Pontifical. ‘Cum cultello aut vitro
      <em>abradit</em> leviter caput degradandi dicens: Consecrationem
      et benedictionem atque <em>unctionem</em> tibi traditam
      <em>radendo</em> delemus.’ So Optatus, with special reference to
      an unction bestowed upon priests, here accuses the Donatists of
      scraping the heads of the Catholic priests whom, without any
      regard for the sanctity of the Holy Oil, they ventured to degrade.
      (Cf. ii, 25 <em>ad fin.</em>: ‘oleum suum defendit Deus,’
      etc.)<br />
      But until now no one seems ever to have imagined that oil was used
      in any part of the Catholic world either in the ordination of
      priests or the consecration of Bishops until the sixth century.
      Thus Duchesne writes (<em>Origines du culte,</em> x, <em>ad
      fin</em>.): ‘<em>L’onction propre au rit Gallican</em> aura été
      suggérée par l’Ancien Testament. Elle ne paraît pas très ancienne.
      Quelques indices porteraient à en chercher l’origine dans les
      Eglises de Bretagne <span>[</span>in fact Gildas alludes to
      it<span>]</span> qui la pratiquaient dès le sixième siècle.’
      Similarly the learned Dr. Hatch writes as follows (Article on
      <em>Ordination</em> in Smith and Cheetham’s <em>Dictionary of
      Christian Antiquities</em>):—‘This rite <span>[</span>anointing of
      the hands of priests<span>]</span> is mentioned by two French
      liturgical writers of the ninth century, Amalarius of Metz (837)
      and Theodulphus of Orleans (821); the earliest canonist who speaks
      of it is Burchard of Worms (1025), but the recognised body of
      canon law distinctly disallows it, quoting a response of Pope
      Nicholas I to the Archbishop of Bourges in 864, who says that it
      is not a custom of the Roman Church, and that he has never heard
      of its being practised in the Christian Church. This must be held
      conclusive, at any rate as to its not being a general practice in
      the ninth century; but afterwards it no doubt became general, for
      Innocent III insists upon it, and objects to the Greeks for their
      omission of it. It is important to note that even the
      Pseudo-Isidorian authorities for the rite refer only to Bishops;
      at the same time they clearly show that the origin of the rite was
      the growing tendency to institute an analogy of ceremonies between
      the Old and New Testament.’ Dr. Hatch proceeds to remark:—’ In
      addition to the anointing of the hands a group of English and

      <li id="fn497"><p><em>Id est qui mente Deum viderint.</em> St.
      Jerome tells us that it was commonly thought in his time that
      Israel signifies <em>vir videns Deum.</em> Great names can be
      quoted for this opinion, and we see in the text that it was taken
      for granted by St. Optatus. It persisted even to the days of St.
      Bernard (cf. <em>serm.</em> 5 <em>ad Fest. Omnium Sanctorum),</em>
      notwithstanding the fact that it had been rejected by St. Jerome
      <em>(Liber Hebraic. Quaestionum in Genesim,</em> 357)—and rightly,
      not only on etymological grounds, but also as being opposed to the
      words of Scripture, which he quotes in his text as follows:—
      ‘Vocabitur nomen tuum Israel, quia invaluisti cum Deo, et cum
      hominibus valebis’ (Gen. xxxiii, 28). The mistake probably arose
      from the next verse but one:—‘Vocavitque Jacob nomen loci illius
      Phanuel dicens: Vidi Deum facie ad faciem.’ St. Jerome understands
      <em>Israel</em> to mean ‘Prince with God’ (Princeps cum Deo). It
      seems, however, more likely that the true meaning is ‘One who
      wrestled with God.’ (From Hebrew <em>Sarah</em> = to fight, to
      strive, and <em>El</em> = God.) Thus the LXX <span>ὅτι ἐνίσχυσας
      μετὰ Θεοῦ</span>. And this sense is in harmony with the context.
      The late Professor Driver (see Article on <em>Jacob</em> in
      Hastings’ <em>Dictionary of the Bible,</em> vol. ii, p. 530)
      writes: ‘The name Israel, meaning (on the analogy of other names
      similarly formed) God persists (or perseveres), is interpreted as
      suggesting the meaning Perseverer with God.’ Professor Driver also
      tells us that Professor ‘Sayce’s derivation from <em>yashar,</em>
      to be upright, to direct (!), has nothing to recommend it.’ (The
      note of exclamation is Driver’s.)<a href="#fnref497" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Elsewhere it is a technical phrase and means simply that the

      quotation—probably from a judgement, cither of Miltiades or of
      Arles—or possibly the words were those of Eunomius and Olimpius

      build an edifice on a ruin. Hence, as he will say immediately,

      Sionis</em> for <em>Onus Vallis Visionis.</em> Optatus’ point here

      Donatists. They who were already Christians were, by an impious
      novelty, rebaptised, that they might become Christians. (Cf. v, 3:
      ‘Qui rebaptizatur, iam Christianus fuerat; quomodo dici potest
      iterum Christianus?’)<a href="#fnref544" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      By <em>aqua divina</em> is meant the water used in Baptism, which,

      This is a sort of summing up in which St. Optatus endeavours, with
      considerable ingenuity, to show once more that Is. xxii, 1-11 has
      reference to the Donatists. We shall perhaps see this more clearly
      if we place his words in juxtaposition with his Latin version of
      Isaiah, which he knew to be familiar to his readers.<br />

      Ecclesia in republica est, id est in Imperio Romano.</em> It had
      from very early times been the custom in the Christian Church to
      pray for the prosperity of the Emperor and the Empire. The
      preservation and the well-being of the Christian Church was
      considered to be in a certain sense dependent on the preservation
      and the well-being of the Roman Empire, inasmuch as the fall of
      the Empire was commonly expected to synchronise with the coming of
      Antichrist and the end of the world—a time of utmost stress and
      affliction for the Church of Christ on earth. It must also be
      remembered that St. Optatus is writing of the local conditions of
      his time. In no sense could the Empire, as a whole, be said to be
      in the Church (even theologically), for as a matter of fact a
      considerable part of the Empire was still pagan. On the other hand
      the Church was confined within the temporal jurisdiction of the
      Empire and overlapped by it on every side. Thus Lord Bryce writes
      with reference to this passage in Optatus: ‘Christianity as well
      as civilisation became conterminous with the Roman Empire’
      (Bryce’s <em>The Holy Roman Empire,</em> p. 11, eighth edition).
      The Church therefore had at that period no claim upon the Empire,
      as such, excepting to be treated with justice; whereas the Empire
      had this claim upon the Church, that the Church, being an external
      organisation within itself (though in a different order), should
      strive to promote peace and harmony and avoid unnecessary
      antagonism. Such good offices and hearty co-operation the temporal
      ruler has always a right to expect from the spiritual society
      within his borders. This the Catholic Church consistently
      remembered; Donatus as consistently forgot.<a href="#fnref564" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      ’Denique, sicut nostis, quicunque Carthaginem nostis, in eodem
      loco Mensa Dei constructa est, et tamen mensa dicitur Cypriani:
      non quia ibi est umquam Cyprianus epulatus, sed quia ibi est
      immolatus, et quia ipsa immolatione sua paravit hanc mensam: non
      in qua pascat sive pascatur; <em>sed in qua sacrificium Deo, cui
      et ipse obtains est, offeratur.’</em><a href="#fnref618" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn621"><p><em>unde proditum est mandatum fuisse fieri quod
      factum est.</em> The command (<em>mandatum</em>) was, I think,
      that of the Donatist Bishops. At first the circumcellions erected
      altars over their dead, but in the open air and not in the
      churches. The later Donatists, when they honoured these slain
      circumcellions as martyrs, forgot not only that it was their own
      Bishops who (after the custom had been introduced of burying them
      in the churches) had ordered their bodies to be exhumed,but also
      that these same Bishops had begged Taurinus to repress them, since
      ecclesiastical discipline had no effect. Therefore <em>they,</em>
      not the Catholics, were responsible for the massacres (‘<em>quod
      factum est</em>’). Both Casaubon and Du Pin, however, understand
      <em>mandatum</em> to refer to a command not of Donatist, but of
      Catholic, Bishops, and think that St. Optatus means to say that
      prejudice was created against Catholics by the exhumation of the
      dead circumcellions, and that on this account Catholics were
      reproached for the alleged massacres. But they seem to forget that
      Optatus has just stated that this was done by the order of a
      Donatist Bishop. It is difficult to see how his command carried
      out by the Donatist priest Clarus could create prejudice against
      Catholics.<a href="#fnref621" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Donatist schism, on account of the character of its originators.
      But even though it must be granted that, under ordinary
      circumstances, a man’s sin does not vitiate the character of his
      work, yet evil conduct and bad lives clearly discredit the
      <em>founders</em> of a new religion or sect, who, as is manifest,
      stand in an altogether exceptional position. Further, in the first
      book Optatus had argued against the Donatists <em>from Donatist
      principles.</em> They said that the Catholic Church had
      apostatised by communicating with <em>Betrayers.</em> Optatus of
      course denies that this was a fact, and proves not only that the
      Donatists themselves had communicated with Betrayers, but also
      that the very founders of their sect were <em>Betrayers.</em> It
      was an <em>argumentum ad hominem,</em> but in the passage before
      us, as elsewhere, he argues from the true principle that the
      character of a workman does no detriment to his work.<a href="#fnref638" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      ‘tacitus loquitur’ (v, 3 ); ‘stulta sapientia’ (vi, 1); and (iii,

      It is most true that the One Catholic Church can never be divided.
      Yet, when large numbers of men, still keeping the Faith, fall into
      schism, they may be said to hang loosely to her in the manner
      described by Optatus in the text: thus ever since the great
      Division between East and West, the separated Eastern Bishops have
      been summoned to the Oecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church,

      <li id="fn736"><p><em>persuasionibus vestris divisa sunt corpora
      et nomina pietatis, et non potuistis praetcr miller e quod
      legitimum est.</em> In this very obscure passage, at first
      reading, it will probably seem that <em>pietatis</em> refers to
      <em>corpora</em> as well as to <em>nomina.</em> But this can
      hardly be the case. I think that it is clear that <em>corpora</em>
      refers to the relationship between husband and wife, <em>nomina
      pietatis</em> to that between parents and their children. The
      chief difficulty is as to the meaning of <em>quod</em>
      <em>legitimum est.</em> The context shows that St. Optatus is
      referring to the division between brother and sister. He has to
      bring in an idea to correspond to <em>corpora</em> and <em>nomina
      pietatis.</em> An unmarried man and woman under ordinary
      circumstances ought not to live alone in the same house, but
      natural law makes an exception for brother and sister. ‘You,’ he
      says, ‘do not spare that affectionate union which natural law
      approves’ (<em>quod legitimum est).</em> Albaspinaeus, however,
      refers <em>quod legitimum est</em> not to the institution of the
      family, to which Optatus has just been alluding, but to that which
      is coming, and understands it thus: ‘And yet you have not been
      able to omit the customary salutations.’ But this involves a full
      stop after <em>pietatis,</em> which is awkward; besides it is
      exceedingly doubtful whether <em>quod legitimum est</em> can bear
      this meaning. Still it may be noted that in ii, 12, St. Optatus
      uses the phrase <em>praeterire illud legitimum</em> for passing
      over that ‘which is prescribed’ at Mass. In his references to the
      sad divisions in families caused by Donatism, St. Optatus shows a
      strange forgetfulness of the fact that such divisions were
      foretold by its divine Founder as an inevitable consequence of the
      spread of Christianity itself (Matt, x, 34; Luke xii, 51).
      Moreover, they must necessarily have followed upon that conversion
      of individual Donatists to the Catholic Church which throughout
      his work Optatus so urgently advocates.<a href="#fnref736" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn760"><p>Cf. Ez. xiii, 13, 14. In the Vulgate we read ‘Et
      erumpere faciam (<em>a</em>) spiritum <em>tempestatum</em> in
      indignatione Mea et (<em>b</em>) <em>imber inundans</em> in furore
      Meo erit, et <em>(c) lapides grandes</em> in ira in consumptionem.
      Et destruam parietem, quem linistis, et cadet.’ From St. Jerome’s
      commentary we find that the LXX had ‘Et disrumpam spiritum
      auferentem in furore Meo, et pluvia inundans in ira Mea erit; et
      lapides magnos (<span>περιβόλους</span>) in furore inducam in
      consummationem. Et suffodiam parietem, quem linistis, et cadet, et
      ponam earn super terrain et revelabuntur fundamenta eius, et cadet
      et <em>consummemini cum increpationibus</em>; et cognoscetis quia
      ego Dominus.’ St. Optatus’ African version gives us (a)
      <em>tempestatem nimiam</em> (b) et <em>pluviam, diluvia</em> (c)
      et <em>lapides petrobolos,</em> et (d) <em>accusationes.</em>
      Where are these last <em>accusaiiones?</em> Probably they are the
      equivalent of the <em>increpationes</em> of St. Jerome. The Greek
      of the LXX has <span>καὶ συντελεσθήσεσθε μετ̕ ἐλέγχων</span>
      (<span>μετ̕ ἐλέγχων</span> <em>= cum accusationibus</em>.) The
      <em>accusationes</em> were to be the last calamity that should
      beset the Donatists. Then they were to fall. One wonders whether
      perhaps St. Optatus thought, though he did not like to say so
      expressly, that his book contained these destined ‘accusations’!<a href="#fnref760" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      priests were not permitted to preach in the presence of a Bishop.
      But Casaubon has no difficulty in showing that Baronius was
      mistaken in thinking that this custom —which St. Augustine tells
      us <em>(Ep.</em> lxxvii) was abolished in his lifetime—was ever
      universal, or that priests were anywhere forbidden to preach
      excepting when a Bishop was present. Still preaching the Word of
      God has always been regarded in the Catholic Church as <em>per

      word <em>Testamentum</em> (<span>διαθήκη</span>), which was
      already in use, though in a quite different sense, for the Sacred
      Books of the New Covenant. Dean Swift in his <em>Tale of a
      Tub</em> (Section II) is thought by some to have had this passage
      in his mind.<a href="#fnref988" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn991"><p>Catholics have always appealed in domestic
      dissensions amongst themselves on theological questions,
      concerning which the Church has not spoken authoritatively, to the
      testimony of (1) Holy Scripture, (2) Apostolic Tradition. In
      dissensions with heretics they have appealed to the testimony of
      Scripture, which heretics profess at least to accept. So St.
      Augustine in controversy with the Donatists makes the same appeal,
      and indeed uses the same words as St. Optatus: ‘Fratres sumus;
      quare litigamus? Non intestatus mortuus est Pater; fecit
      testamentumet sic mortuus est . . . Sedet Christus in caelo, et
      contradicitur Eius testamento’ (<em>in Ps.</em> xxi). But St.
      Augustine makes this appeal with greater caution than did St.
      Optatus. St. Optatus in the text appeals to John xiii, 7, in order
      to prove that Baptism may not be repeated; whereas St. Augustine,
      who no doubt felt that this was a forced application (cf. <em>con.
      Petil.</em> ii, 22) of the text, prefers to press the appeal to
      Scripture in order to prove thereby that the Catholic Church is
      the one Church of Christ. This he does without ceasing, urging the
      authority of the Catholic Church as decisive. When the discussion
      concerns any particular question (e.g. the repetition of Baptism)
      St. Augustine prefers to appeal to Apostolic Tradition rather than
      to Holy Scripture (cf. <em>De Unit.</em> xix; <em>De Bapt.</em>
      ii, 7, iv, 6, v, 23).<a href="#fnref991" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      has to be chosen, and consequently is external to the ‘body’ of
      Baptism. This reminds us of the converse argument that
      <em>Umbilicus</em> cannot be reckoned as one of the Endowments,
      because it is not external to the Body of the Church, but is a
      member (<em>membrum)</em> of that Body (ii, 8). Evidently St.

      homines.</em> Harnack writes of these words (<em>History of
      Dogma,</em> v, p. 42): ‘This is the famous principle of the
      objectivity of the Sacraments, which became so fundamental for the
      development of the dogmatics of the Western Church, although it
      could not be carried out in all its purity in the Roman Church,
      because in that case it would have destroyed the prerogatives of
      the clergy.’ It is difficult to see what Harnack had in his mind
      when he wrote this last qualifying sentence. Nothing can be more
      certain than that the Roman Church has always taught, without any
      limitation or qualification whatsoever, that the efficacy of the
      Sacraments is always and everywhere independent of the virtues or
      vices of those who administer them. Harnack in this passage
      probably used the words <em>Roman Church</em> as synonymous with
      <em>Western Church</em> (although this would not appear to be the
      case at first reading), since he would not wish to suggest that
      there is any difference in doctrine or practice between any
      Catholic Church in the West and the Church in Rome. But whilst
      recognising this, we are none the nearer to a comprehension of his

      This was the great argument of St. Cyprian and his school against
      the validity of Baptism outside the Church. ’How,’ they asked,
      ‘can a man give the Faith which he has not got? No one can give
      what he has not.’ In like manner the Donatists went on to argue
      that Baptism by a sinner was invalid, for—so they urged—by true
      Baptism grace is given; but the sinner without grace, cannot give
      what he has not. To this St. Optatus answers that it is God, not

      non potest.</em> It is very difficult to understand what is meant
      here by <em>ut teneat.</em> How can water hold the vines? Possibly
      <em>he</em> may be the subject of <em>teneat:</em> ‘He cannot
      command the vines, so as to keep them there.’ If for
      <em>teneat</em> we read <em>teneant,</em> we might translate in an
      intransitive sense: ‘He cannot order that they hold’ =
      <em>coalescere in terram</em> (infra). But nothing is really
      satisfactory. Casaubon thinks that the <em>ut teneat</em> is
      probably a corrupt gloss due to some scribe who could not
      understand the <em>imperare</em> standing alone. The meaning is
      clear. It is God alone who can ripen the vine. Casaubon suggests
      that if St. Optatus wrote anything between <em>imperare</em> and
      <em>non potest,</em> it was <em>vineae.</em> On the other hand,
      cf. iv, 9: <em>Lacus detritos, qui non possunt aquam
      continere.</em> St. Optatus, who often slightly varies his
      phrases, may have had this phrase unconsciously lingering in his

      hardly necessary to point out that no such incident as that here
      described is to be found in any of the Gospels. Optatus seems to

      argument <em>Nemo dat quod non habet,</em> that the real giver is
      God. He now proves that God does not ’<em>work’ (vacat),</em> but
      is always ready to <em>give,</em> and lets the recipient receive
      according to his faith. Unless he who is to be baptised possesses
      faith, God will not give the grace of Baptism, even as our Lord on

      <li id="fn1172"><p><em>dantis est, non accipientis.</em> It is
      clear that Parmenian had given a series of proofs, concluding at
      the end of each: <em>Dantis est, non accipientis,</em> and Optatus
      ironically repeats the words. According to the argument of St.
      Optatus there are three ‘species’: (<span>α</span>) The Name of
      the Trinity by which all the grace is given; (<span>β</span>) the
      minister of the Sacrament, who is only instrumental—a servant; and
      (<span>γ</span>) the faith of the recipient, which by the ministry
      of (<span>γ</span>) impetrates the grace from (<span>α</span>).
      Finally therefore all depends upon (<span>γ</span>). The Trinity
      is unchangeable, the minister a mere servant, but the disposition
      of the recipient all-important. If, then, outside the Church the
      recipient has faith the Baptism will be valid. Of course this
      implies that although baptism <em>by</em> heretics (if
      administered in the Name of the Trinity) is valid, the baptism
      <em>of</em> a heretic is invalid. But we have to bear in mind that
      St. Optatus assumes (for such had so far for the most part been
      the experience of the Church) that a heretic does not believe in
      the Trinity or in the Catholic Doctrine of the Incarnation (cf.
      note i, p. 17). His argument, so far as it is here stated (apart
      from any implications), is good, but incomplete. The doctrine of
      <em>character</em> handed down by the Greek Fathers was unknown to
      St. Optatus. He had no idea of <em>character</em> being given
      without grace, nor of <em>reviviscentia</em> on arriving at true
      and living Faith.<a href="#fnref1172" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Tunic, wherewith He may clothe many who are born in the water (the

      unnecessary. The spiritual garment of grace is Christ, whom the
      baptised ‘puts on’ <em>(induit),</em> as the water flows over him.
      But St. Optatus will not identify Christ with the water—so He is
      the Grace in the water—a spiritual garment invisibly ‘floating in
      the water,’ which clothes the baptised, as the water covers him.
      It is a very beautiful idea. There seems to be no reference here

      Mass at the same altars with the same chalices. It seems however
      to me that the thought of St. Optatus may be expressed more
      simply. If the Donatists imagined that by burning the chalices
      which they considered to have been polluted through the touch of
      Catholic priests, they were burning away that touch—in the
      concrete, those hands—they should remember that at the same time
      they were burning away their own touch—their own hands—for they
      too had touched the chalices which they burned. The drift of the
      argument is sufficiently clear, but to us it must seem laboured
      and far-fetched (cf. note 4, p. 255).<a href="#fnref1255" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn1361"><p><em>dum non pertinuit ad Seth, filium Adae,
      patris admissum.</em> From the theological point of view this has
      been considered the most difficult passage to be found in the
      works of St. Optatus. St. Augustine writes (<em>de Haer.</em> 19):
      ‘<em>Sethiani</em> nomen acceperunt a filio Adae, qui vocatus est
      Seth. Eum quippe honorant, sed fabulosa et haeretica vanitate.’
      The Sethitic legend is distinctly African. Julius Africanus is
      quoted as one of the first Christian writers to extol this
      Patriarch unduly, and the legend went on growing. Some, therefore,
      have thought that St. Optatus had received unawares a false
      tradition from heretical sources about Seth. Thus Casaubon writes
      with regard to this passage of Optatus: ‘Non ego is iam, qui
      gravius quidquam de viro sancto pronuntiaverim. Id tantum dicam,
      vereri me, ne imprudenti et incauto illi haec exciderint, quae
      saevioris examinis acrimoniam aegre sustineant.’ All the other
      commentators pass the passage over in silence. But is it not
      almost certain that St. Optatus had not the doctrine of original
      sin before his mind at all? With much probability it may be urged
      that the question here concerns not Adam <em>qua</em> father of
      the human race, but Adam considered as any other father. <em>In
      this sense</em> it is clear that Adam’s sins were not attributed
      to his son Seth any more than are the sins of any other father
      attributed to any other son. We must always bear in mind that
      Optatus wrote before the rise of the Pelagian heresy. Still, the
      difficulty will remain unanswered: Why should Optatus in this
      connection have mentioned Seth rather than Abel, or even Cain?<a href="#fnref1361" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      Ecclesia.</em> If St. Augustine at the Conference at Carthage had
      remembered and employed these careful words of St. Optatus—‘the
      field in which is the Church,’ he would have been saved a tiresome
      discussion with his Donatist adversaries. The Donatists naturally
      and triumphantly replied to the argument of the Catholics that the
      tares had to grow up with the wheat in the Field, and that the
      Field is the Church: ‘Oh no, on the contrary, the Maker of the
      world Himself has said that <em>the Field is the world.</em> Now
      “the world has not known the Father.” But if (as you say) the
      Church is the Field, it is also the world, for “the Field is the
      world.” Therefore the Church has not known the Father! Which is
      absurd.’ To this ingenious syllogism St. Augustine had to rely
      upon a long explanation as to the different meaning of the word
      ‘world’ in Holy Scripture (<em>Gesta Coll. Carthag. Diei</em> iii,
      cclxv-cclxxxi; <em>Brev. Coll.</em> iii, 10). No exception could
      have been taken to the statement of Optatus ‘the Church is
      <em>in</em> the world.’ Had it been used, the Donatists would have
      been deprived of one of their many opportunities of wasting
      time.<a href="#fnref1372" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      praeferri Apostolis omnibus meruit et claves regni caelorum
      communicandas ceteris solus accepit.</em> After
      <em>communicandas</em> some Gallican and Anglican authorities have
      supplied <em>a Christo.</em> Thus Dr. Pusey (Note R to Tertullian,
      Oxford Translation of the Fathers). Similarly Mr. Denny (<em>op.
      cit.,</em> n. 1165) writes ‘that is, as Bossuet says, that Peter
      <em>first</em> received the keys which were afterwards to be
      imparted to the Apostles (Matt, xviii and John xx), but to be
      imparted not by Peter, but by Christ, as is clear.’ Dr. Pusey
      sends us to Du Pin. Now it is curious that in his edition of St.
      Optatus Du Pin has no note whatsoever on this passage. Dr. Pusey,
      however, refers to his <em>De Antiqua Ecclesiae disciplina
      Dissertationes historicae,</em> where we read as follows
      (<em>Diss.</em> iv, cap. i): ‘communicandas ceteris (<em>id est
      quod Christus commendaturus erat ceteris</em>).’ But it should be
      noted that neither Du Pin nor Bossuet nor Denny say one single
      word in support of their view that <em>a Christo</em> should be
      understood after the word <em>communicandas</em> in this passage
      of Optatus. It is simple assertion, to which Bossuet adds the
      words ‘as is clear’ (<em>Defensio Decl. Cleri Gallicani,</em> pars
      III, lib. viii, cap. xii, tom. ii, p. 90); on the other hand, it
      should be observed that we nowhere read either in Matt. xviii or
      in John xx—the passages referred to by Bossuet—that Christ gave
      the Keys to the other Apostles. With regard to the words of St.
      Optatus we may note in the first place that we shall search in
      vain for any passage where he states that Christ gave the Keys to
      ‘the other Apostles’; on the contrary Optatus says expressly, both
      here and in i, 10 (‘ut haeretici omnes neque claves habeant, quas
      <em>solus</em> Petrus accepit’), that Peter <em>alone</em>
      received them; so that for the Gallican interpretation of this
      passage to be possible we should have to change the word
      <em>solus</em> to <em>primus</em>—the <em>alone</em> of Optatus
      for the <em>first</em> of Bossuet; secondly that, though Optatus
      uses the verb <em>communicare</em> in eighteen places, in every
      other case it is used intransitively—twice absolutely and fifteen
      times with the dative—in the technical sense of ecclesiastical
      communion (to be in communion with). Here however we find the
      usual classical construction, <em>communicare aliquid</em> (here
      <em>claves</em>) <em>cum aliquo</em> or <em>alicui</em> (here
      <em>ceteris</em>). <em>Communicare aliquid alicui</em> always
      means in Latin to give something (e.g. information, power, here
      the Keys) to someone else, without ceasing to possess it
      oneself—to make it a common possession shared between oneself and
      the other (cf. Liv. <em>Lib.</em> xxiii, 5: ‘Civitatem nostram
      magnae parti vestrum dedimus communicavimusque vobiscum,’ and
      Cicero <em>De Inv.</em> ii, 39: ‘Praemia virtutis non oportet cum
      improbis communicari’). This is undeniable and forces us to see
      that the gloss <em>a Christo</em> is impossible—apart from the
      exigencies of controversy—and does violence to the text, to which
      indeed it is in direct opposition. The meaning is clea beyond all
      doubt—‘the Keys which he was to communicate to the rest.’ St.
      Peter had to impart to the other Apostles, for them <em>to</em>
      use also, the Keys which, as their ‘Head’ (cf. <em>infra),</em> he

      <li id="fn1454"><p>Matt. xii, 22. Casaubon thinks that St. Optatus
      could not have made this quotation, and that it slipped in from a
      marginal note. It is quite true that the object of St. Optatus,
      which was to show that the Donatists were not only <em>muscae</em>
      (flies) but also <em>muscae moriturae</em> (flies that were about
      to die), would have been attained without the quotation. It would
      have been enough for his purpose to have said that their
      rebaptising was a great sin and that ‘sin without pardon—until it
      is pardoned—is death.’ But unhappily he has already said (v, 3)
      that rebaptising (as involving a certain exorcism of the Holy
      Ghost) is that sin against the Holy Ghost for which there is no
      forgiveness in this world, or in the world to come. So hard was it
      to kill rigorism in the African Church, that we find it even in
      unexpected places. Still, we rejoice to find that St. Optatus is
      not always consistent with himself in this terrible severity. We
      have seen how clear he was that even these rebaptisers should have
      been reconciled with the Church, had they been willing.<a href="#fnref1454" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn1458"><p><em>Cathedram Petri et claves regni caelorum a
      Christo concessas, ubi est nostra societas, numquid poteris
      adprobare mendacium?</em> (cf. ii, 23: ‘Negare non potes scire te
      in urbe Roma . . . <em>societate</em> concordat’). The Donatists
      claimed that they possessed the truth. To this Optatus opposed the
      authority of the Catholic Church and set out the grounds of
      Catholic security in three pertinent questions:<br />
      <em>(a)</em> Is it a lie (a delusion) to appeal to the fact of
      communion with the Catholic Church throughout the world? ‘<em>Is
      it a delusion that we are in one communion with the whole</em>
      <span>[</span><em>Catholic</em><span>]</span>
      <em>world,?’</em><br />
      <em>(b)</em> Is it a delusion that we keep and guard the
      Creed?’<em>Is it a delusion that we keep and defend the true and
      one Creed?‘<em><br />
      </em>(c) <em>Is the Chair of Peter a delusion? ’</em>But you
      cannot deny that you know that Peter established his Chair at
      Rome.’</em> Or, is it a delusion that we are in communion with
      that Chair? Or, is it, perhaps, a delusion that Christ gave the
      Keys of Heaven to Peter?—the Keys of Heaven which, through our
      communion with the Chair of Peter, we share (‘<em>ubi est nostra
      societas</em>’: cf. i, 12; ii, 4; ii, 9).<br />
      Is this all a falsehood—a mere delusion? (‘<em>Numquid poteris
      adprobare mendacium?</em>’)<br />
      Such is the argument of Optatus. He appealed just as Catholics
      appeal to-day (and as they always have appealed):<br />
      1. To communion with the Catholic Church in other lands,<br />
      2. To the possession of the Creed,<br />
      3. To communion with the Chair of Peter.<br />
      This is the ultimate assurance of safety for a Catholic that he is
      in the true Church of Christ—the <em>Soliditas Cathedrae
      Petri.</em> This is no freak of the imagination
      (<em>mendacium</em>). Here beyond all doubt we find and here we

      prepared for torture, but not actually tortured, because he said
      that he was a decurion. <em>Submitte</em> corresponds to

      favourable to Ingentius, and turns upon Caecilianus: ‘Your

      Petilianus complained that another Catholic Bishop named Delphinus
      (who was too ill to attend the Conference) was living ‘in the
      middle of his Diocese.’ St. Augustine tells us (<em>Ep.</em>
      cxxxix) that this Delphinus had been sent to Numidia by his
      fellow-Bishops on account of the needs of the Church. At the
      Conference of Carthage there was a passage of arms between
      Fortunatus and Petilianus. When the latter heard the name of the
      former read aloud, he cried out ‘Ipse est persecutor Ecclesiae in

      ad bibliothecam’ (<em>ibid.</em> iv, 56). From these two passages
      Masson made up his reading, accepted by Du Pin, <em>Posteaquam
      perventum est in bibliothecam.</em> But, as Baluzius points out,
      the old reading may well stand, for <em>bibliotheca</em> here
      probably means <em>bookcase.</em> Thus Possidius in his life of

      In <em>quinions</em> and <em>ternions</em> it was necessary to
      have them alternately hair and smooth face outside. (The codices

      Codices came into frequent use in the course of the third century,

      Augustinus in <em>Lib. post Collat.</em> cap. 24 ait Donatistas a
      Primate suo per Tractoriam fuisse evocatos. Tractoria verbum est

      Constantini facientis memoriam Tractoriarum et Evectionis publicae

      the same right of public conveyances to the Bishops for Nicaea,
      and his successors did the same for all the great Councils of the
      Church—they had the Bishops conveyed at the public cost in the
      regular imperial post-chaises. So this letter of Constantine with
      regard to the Council of Arles is rendered more interesting from
