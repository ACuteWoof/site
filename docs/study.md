*Letter ascribed to Tommaso d'Aquino to brother John on how to study.*

Since you asked me, my dearest in Christ Brother John, how you should
study in order to acquire the treasure of knowledge, I offer you this
advice on the matter: Do not wish to jump immediately from the streams
to the sea, because one has to go through easier things to the more
difficult. Therefore the following points are my warning and your
instruction:

- I command you to be slow to speak, and slow to go to the conversation
  room.

- Embrace purity of conscience.

- Do not give up spending time in prayer.

- Love spending much time in your cell, if you want to be led into the
  wine cellar.

- Show yourself amiable to all.

- Do not query at all what others are doing.

- Do not be very familiar with anyone, because familiarity breeds
  contempt, and provides matter for distracting you from study.

- Do not get involved at all in the discussions and affairs of lay
  people.

- Avoid conversations about all any and every matter.

- Do not fail to imitate the example of good and holy men.

- Do not consider who the person is you are listening to, but whatever
  good he says commit to memory.

- Whatever you are doing and hearing try to understand. Resolve doubts,
  and put whatever you can in the storeroom of your mind, like someone
  wanting to fill a container.

- Do not spend time on things beyond your grasp.

Following such a path, you will bring forth flowers and produce useful
fruit for the vinyard of the Lord of Power and Might, as long as you
live. If you follow this, you can reach what you desire.
