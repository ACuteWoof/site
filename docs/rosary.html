        In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
      </p>
      <h2 id="apostles-creed">Apostles Creed</h2>
      <p>
        Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in
        Iesum Christum, Filium eius unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui conceptus est
        de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus sub Pontio Pilato,
        crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus, descendit ad infernos, tertia die
        resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris
        omnipotentis, inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in
        Spiritum Sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem,
        remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam aeternam. Amen.

      <p>
        I believe in God, the Father almighty creator of heaven and earth and in
        Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy
        Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
        crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third
        day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated
        at the right hand of God, the Father almighty. He will come again in
        glory to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
        the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of
        sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

      <h3 id="the-annunciation">The Annunciation</h3>
      <p>
        In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of
        Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was
        Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And he
        came to her and said, “Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” But
        she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what
        sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be
        afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will
        conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
        He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; he Lord
        God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign
        over the house of Jacob for ever; f his kingdom there will be no end.”
        And Mary said to the angel, “How shall this be, since I have no
        husband?” And the angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon
        you, he power of the Most High will overshadow you; fore the child to be
        born will be called holy, on of God. And behold, your kinswoman
        Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth
        month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be
        impossible.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let
        it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-visitation">The Visitation</h3>
      <p>
        In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the
        hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted
        Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leapt in her
        womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a
        loud cry, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
        womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes
        to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in
        my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would
        be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.’
      </p>
      <p>And Mary said,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ‘My soul magnifies the Lord,<br />
          and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,<br />
          for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.<br />
          Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br />
          for the Mighty One has done great things for me,<br />
          and holy is his name.<br />
          His mercy is for those who fear him<br />
          from generation to generation.<br />
          He has shown strength with his arm;<br />
          he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.<br />
          He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,<br />
          and lifted up the lowly;<br />
          he has filled the hungry with good things,<br />
          and sent the rich away empty.<br />
          He has helped his servant Israel,<br />
          in remembrance of his mercy,<br />
          according to the promise he made to our ancestors,<br />
          to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.’
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        And Mary remained with her for about three months and then returned to
        her home.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-nativity">The Nativity</h3>
      <p>
        And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And
        she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling
        cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in
        the inn.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch
        over their flock by night.
      </p>
      <p>
        And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord
        shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to
        them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy
        which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the
        city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign
        for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a
        manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
        heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and
        on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!”
      </p>
      <p>
        When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to
        one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has
        happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying
        in a manger. And when they saw it they made known the saying which had
        been told them concerning this child; and all who heard it wondered at
        what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things, pondering
        them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising
        God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-presentation">The Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man
        was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the
        Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy
        Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s
        Christ. And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the
        parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the
        custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
        “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
        word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared in
        the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and
        for glory to thy people Israel.”
      </p>
      <p>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him;</p>
      <p>
        and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child
        is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is
        spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also),
        that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phan’u-el, of the
        tribe of Asher; she was of a great age, having lived with her husband
        seven years from her virginity,
      </p>
      <p>
        and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the
        temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up
        at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who
        were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord,
        they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor
        of God was upon him.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-finding-in-the-temple">The Finding in the Temple</h3>
      <p>
        Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
        Passover.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom; and
        when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed
        behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to
        be in the company they went a day’s journey, and they sought him among
        their kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they
        returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days they found him in
        the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking
        them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding
        and his answers. And when they saw him they were astonished; and his
        mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your
        father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” And he said to them,
        “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my
        Father’s house?” And they did not understand the saying which he spoke
        to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was
        obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and
        man.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-luminous-mysteries">The Luminous Mysteries</h2>
      <h3 id="the-baptism">The Baptism</h3>
      <p>
        In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of
        Judea, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” For this is he
        who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one
        crying in the wilderness: are the way of the Lord, his paths straight.”
        Now John wore a garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle around his
        waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him
        Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan, and they
        were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. But
        when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sad’ducees coming for baptism, he
        said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the
        wrath to come? Bear fruit that befits repentance, and do not presume to
        say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’; for I tell you, God
        is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the
        axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not
        bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. “I baptize you
        with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier
        than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with
        the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he
        will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary,
        but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” Then Jesus came from
        Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have
        prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to
        me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting
        for us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus
        was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the
        heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,
        and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, “This is my
        beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-wedding-at-cana">The Wedding at Cana</h3>
      <p>
        On the third day there was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and the mother
        of Jesus was there;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples. When the
        wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And
        Jesus said to her, “O woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has
        not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells
        you.” Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of
        purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them,
        “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. He said
        to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast.”
        So they took it. When the steward of the feast tasted the water now
        become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants
        who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the
        bridegroom and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first; and
        when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the
        good wine until now.” This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in
        Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this he went down to Caper’na-um, with his mother and his brothers
        and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-proclamation-of-the-kingdom">
        The Proclamation of the Kingdom
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the
        gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of
        God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the
        brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you become fishers of
        men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going
        on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zeb’edee and John his
        brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he
        called them; and they left their father Zeb’edee in the boat with the
        hired servants, and followed him.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-transfiguration">The Transfiguration</h3>
      <p>
        And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his
        brother, and led them up a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured
        before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became
        white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Eli’jah,
        talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is well that we are
        here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one
        for Moses and one for Eli’jah.” He was still speaking, when lo, a bright
        cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my
        beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” When the
        disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with
        awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise, and have no fear.”
        And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. And
        as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no
        one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead.” And the
        disciples asked him, “Then why do the scribes say that first Eli’jah
        must come?” He replied, “Eli’jah does come, and he is to restore all
        things; but I tell you that Eli’jah has already come, and they did not
        know him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of man
        will suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that he was
        speaking to them of John the Baptist.

        While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing
        it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, ‘Take, eat; this is
        my body.’ Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to
        them, saying, ‘Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the
        covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I
        tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that
        day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.’
      </p>
      <p>When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
      <p>
        Then Jesus said to them, ‘You will all become deserters because of me
        this night; for it is written, “I will strike the shepherd, and the
        sheep of the flock will be scattered.” But after I am raised up, I will
        go ahead of you to Galilee.’

        He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the
        disciples followed him. When he reached the place, he said to them,
        ‘Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.’ Then he withdrew
        from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed, ‘Father, if you
        are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be
        done.’ Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.
        In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great
        drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he got up from prayer,
        he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, and
        he said to them, ‘Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not
        come into the time of trial.’

        Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for
        whom they asked. Now a man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels
        who had committed murder during the insurrection. So the crowd came and
        began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom. Then he
        answered them, ‘Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?’
        For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had
        handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him
        release Barabbas for them instead. Pilate spoke to them again, ‘Then
        what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?’
        They shouted back, ‘Crucify him!’ Pilate asked them, ‘Why, what evil has
        he done?’ But they shouted all the more, ‘Crucify him!’ So Pilate,
        wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after
        flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-crowning-with-thorns">The Crowning with Thorns</h3>
      <p>
        Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a
        crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple
        robe. They kept coming up to him, saying, ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’ and
        striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, ‘Look,
        I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against
        him.’ So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple
        robe. Pilate said to them, ‘Here is the man!’ When the chief priests and
        the police saw him, they shouted, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’ Pilate
        said to them, ‘Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case
        against him.’ The Jews answered him, ‘We have a law, and according to
        that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.’
      </p>
      <p>Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever.</p>
      <h3 id="the-carrying-of-the-cross">The Carrying of the Cross</h3>
      <p>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>
      <p>
        So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to
        what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called
        Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on
        either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription
        written and put on the cross. It read, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, the King of
        the Jews.’ Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place
        where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in
        Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said
        to Pilate, ‘Do not write, “The King of the Jews”, but, “This man said, I
        am King of the Jews.” ’ Pilate answered, ‘What I have written I have
        written.’
      </p>
      <h3 id="the-crucifixion">The Crucifixion</h3>
      <p>And that is what the soldiers did.</p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his
        mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus
        saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he
        said to his mother, ‘Woman, here is your son.’ Then he said to the
        disciple, ‘Here is your mother.’ And from that hour the disciple took
        her into his own home.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order
        to fulfil the scripture), ‘I am thirsty.’ A jar full of sour wine was
        standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of
        hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he
        said, ‘It is finished.’ Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

        After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary
        Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. And suddenly there
        was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from
        heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was
        like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. For fear of him the
        guards shook and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women,
        ‘Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was
        crucified. He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see
        the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, “He has
        been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to
        Galilee; there you will see him.” This is my message for you.’ So they
        left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his
        disciples.

        But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and
        you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to
        the ends of the earth.’ When he had said this, as they were watching, he
        was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was
        going and they were gazing up towards heaven, suddenly two men in white
        robes stood by them. They said, ‘Men of Galilee, why do you stand
        looking up towards heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you
        into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.’

        When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
        And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent
        wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided
        tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of
        them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
        other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in
        Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered,
        because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.
        Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the
        name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will
        receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you, for
        your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our
        God calls to him.’ And he testified with many other arguments and
        exhorted them, saying, ‘Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.’
        So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about
        three thousand persons were added.

        A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with
        the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She
        was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs, in the agony of giving
        birth. Then another portent appeared in heaven: a great red dragon, with
        seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he
        pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. But the woman
        was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she could fly from
        the serpent into the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished for
        a time, and times, and half a time. Then from his mouth the serpent
        poured water like a river after the woman, to sweep her away with the
        flood. But the earth came to the help of the woman; it opened its mouth
        and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth. Then
        the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the
        rest of her children, those who keep the commandments of God and hold
        the testimony of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>Then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.</p>

        swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth.
        Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, so
        that he might devour her child as soon as it was born. And she gave
        birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod
        of iron. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his
        throne;
