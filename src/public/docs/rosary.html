        <p>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen</p>
        <p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
        Spirit. Amen</p>
        <h2 id="apostles-creed">Apostles Creed</h2>
        <p>Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae.
        Et in Iesum Christum, Filium eius unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui
        conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus
        sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus, descendit
        ad infernos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad
        caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis, inde venturus
        est iudicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in Spiritum Sanctum,
        sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem, remissionem
        peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam aeternam. Amen.</p>
        <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty creator of heaven and
        earth and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was
        conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered
        under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He
        descended into hell. On the third day he rose again from the
        dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of
        God, the Father almighty. He will come again in glory to judge
        the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy
        Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of
        sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.
        Amen.</p>
        <h2 id="our-father">Our Father</h2>
        <p>Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum.
        Adveniat regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in
        terra. Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte
        nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
        Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo.
        Amen.</p>
        <p>Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name; thy
        kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give
        us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we
        forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into
        temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>

        <p>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in

        <p>Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art
        thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

        Amen.</p>
        <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
        Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
        world without end. Amen.</p>
        <h2 id="the-fatima-prayer">The Fatima Prayer</h2>
        <p>Domine Iesu, dimitte nobis debita nostra, salva nos ab igne

        ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos misericordes oculos ad nos
        converte. Et Iesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui, nobis post
        hoc exsilium ostende. O clemens, o pia, o dulcis Virgo
        Maria.</p>
        <p>Ora pro nobis, sancta Dei Genitrix. Ut digni efficamur

        <p>Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness
        and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.
        To thee to we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this
        valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes
        of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the
        blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet
        Virgin Mary.</p>
        <p>Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. That we may be made worthy
        of the promises of Christ.</p>
        <h1 id="the-mysteries">The Mysteries</h1>
        <h2 id="the-joyful-mysteries">The Joyful Mysteries</h2>
        <h3 id="the-annunciation">The Annunciation</h3>
        <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a
        city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man
        whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s
        name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Hail, O favored
        one, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the
        saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this
        might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary,
        for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive
        in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
        He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High;
        he Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and
        he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; f his kingdom
        there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How shall
        this be, since I have no husband?” And the angel said to her,
        “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, he power of the Most High
        will overshadow you; fore the child to be born will be called
        holy, on of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old
        age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with
        her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be
        impossible.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the
        Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel
        departed from her.</p>
        <h3 id="the-visitation">The Visitation</h3>
        <p>In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean
        town in the hill country, where she entered the house of
        Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s
        greeting, the child leapt in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled
        with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, ‘Blessed are
        you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why
        has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me?
        For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in
        my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that
        there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the
        Lord.’</p>
        <p>And Mary said,</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>‘My soul magnifies the Lord,<br />
        and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,<br />
        for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his
        servant.<br />
        Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br />
        for the Mighty One has done great things for me,<br />
        and holy is his name.<br />
        His mercy is for those who fear him<br />
        from generation to generation.<br />
        He has shown strength with his arm;<br />
        he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their
        hearts.<br />
        He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,<br />
        and lifted up the lowly;<br />
        he has filled the hungry with good things,<br />
        and sent the rich away empty.<br />
        He has helped his servant Israel,<br />
        in remembrance of his mercy,<br />
        according to the promise he made to our ancestors,<br />
        to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.’<br />
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And Mary remained with her for about three months and then
        returned to her home.</p>
        <h3 id="the-nativity">The Nativity</h3>
        <p>And while they were there, the time came for her to be
        delivered. And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped
        him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there
        was no place for them in the inn.</p>
        <p>And in that region there were shepherds out in the field,
        keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>
        <p>And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of
        the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And
        the angel said to them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you
        good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for
        to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is
        Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find
        a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And
        suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
        host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and
        on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!”</p>
        <p>When the angels went away from them into heaven, the
        shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and
        see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known
        to us.”</p>
        <p>And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the
        babe lying in a manger. And when they saw it they made known the
        saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all
        who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary
        kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the
        shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had
        heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>
        <h3 id="the-presentation">The Presentation</h3>
        <p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and
        this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation
        of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been
        revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death
        before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And inspired by the Spirit
        he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the
        child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,
        he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now
        lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word;
        for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared
        in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the
        Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel.”</p>
        <p>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about
        him;</p>
        <p>and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold,
        this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and
        for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce
        through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts
        may be revealed.”</p>
        <p>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phan’u-el,
        of the tribe of Asher; she was of a great age, having lived with
        her husband seven years from her virginity,</p>
        <p>and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart
        from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and
        day. And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and
        spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of
        Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>And when they had performed everything according to the law
        of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city,
        Nazareth.</p>
        <p>And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and
        the favor of God was upon him.</p>
        <h3 id="the-finding-in-the-temple">The Finding in the
        Temple</h3>
        <p>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
        the Passover.</p>
        <p>And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to
        custom; and when the feast was ended, as they were returning,
        the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not
        know it, but supposing him to be in the company they went a
        day’s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
        acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they returned to
        Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days they found him in the
        temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking
        them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his
        understanding and his answers. And when they saw him they were
        astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you
        treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for
        you anxiously.” And he said to them, “How is it that you sought
        me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” And
        they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. And
        he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to
        them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart.</p>
        <p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor
        with God and man.</p>
        <h2 id="the-luminous-mysteries">The Luminous Mysteries</h2>
        <h3 id="the-baptism">The Baptism</h3>
        <p>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
        wilderness of Judea, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
        hand.” For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah
        when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: are
        the way of the Lord, his paths straight.” Now John wore a
        garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle around his waist;
        and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him
        Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan, and
        they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their
        sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sad’ducees
        coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who
        warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit that
        befits repentance, and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We
        have Abraham as our father’; for I tell you, God is able from
        these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the axe
        is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does
        not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. “I
        baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming
        after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to
        carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
        His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his
        threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary, but the
        chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” Then Jesus came from
        Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would
        have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and
        do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now;
        for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then
        he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, he went up
        immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened
        and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and
        alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, “This is
        my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</p>
        <h3 id="the-wedding-at-cana">The Wedding at Cana</h3>
        <p>On the third day there was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and
        the mother of Jesus was there;</p>
        <p>Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples.
        When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They
        have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “O woman, what have you to
        do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the
        servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” Now six stone jars were
        standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each
        holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, “Fill the
        jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. He said
        to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the
        feast.” So they took it. When the steward of the feast tasted
        the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from
        (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward
        of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Every man
        serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then
        the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.” This,
        the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and
        manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p>
        <p>After this he went down to Caper’na-um, with his mother and
        his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few
        days.</p>
        <h3 id="the-proclamation-of-the-kingdom">The Proclamation of the
        Kingdom</h3>
        <p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee,
        preaching the gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled,
        and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the
        gospel.”</p>
        <p>And passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
        Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they
        were fishermen.</p>
        <p>And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you become
        fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and
        followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the
        son of Zeb’edee and John his brother, who were in their boat
        mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left
        their father Zeb’edee in the boat with the hired servants, and
        followed him.</p>
        <h3 id="the-transfiguration">The Transfiguration</h3>
        <p>And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and
        John his brother, and led them up a high mountain apart. And he
        was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun,
        and his garments became white as light. And behold, there
        appeared to them Moses and Eli’jah, talking with him. And Peter
        said to Jesus, “Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish,
        I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and
        one for Eli’jah.” He was still speaking, when lo, a bright cloud
        overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my
        beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” When
        the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were
        filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise,
        and have no fear.” And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw
        no one but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the
        mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no one the vision, until
        the Son of man is raised from the dead.” And the disciples asked
        him, “Then why do the scribes say that first Eli’jah must come?”
        He replied, “Eli’jah does come, and he is to restore all things;
        but I tell you that Eli’jah has already come, and they did not
        know him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son
        of man will suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples
        understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p>
        <h3 id="the-institution-of-the-eucharist">The Institution of the
        Eucharist</h3>
        <p>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after
        blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said,
        ‘Take, eat; this is my body.’ Then he took a cup, and after
        giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink from it, all of
        you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
        for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never
        again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I
        drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.’</p>
        <p>When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of
        Olives.</p>
        <p>Then Jesus said to them, ‘You will all become deserters
        because of me this night; for it is written, “I will strike the
        shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.” But
        after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.’</p>
        <h2 id="the-sorrowful-mysteries">The Sorrowful Mysteries</h2>
        <h3 id="the-agony-in-the-garden">The Agony in the Garden</h3>
        <p>He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of
        Olives; and the disciples followed him. When he reached the
        place, he said to them, ‘Pray that you may not come into the
        time of trial.’ Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s
        throw, knelt down, and prayed, ‘Father, if you are willing,
        remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.’
        Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.
        In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became
        like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he
        got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them
        sleeping because of grief, and he said to them, ‘Why are you
        sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of
        trial.’</p>
        <h3 id="the-scourging-at-the-pillar">The Scourging at the
        Pillar</h3>
        <p>Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them,
        anyone for whom they asked. Now a man called Barabbas was in
        prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the
        insurrection. So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do
        for them according to his custom. Then he answered them, ‘Do you
        want me to release for you the King of the Jews?’ For he
        realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had
        handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to
        have him release Barabbas for them instead. Pilate spoke to them
        again, ‘Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the
        King of the Jews?’ They shouted back, ‘Crucify him!’ Pilate
        asked them, ‘Why, what evil has he done?’ But they shouted all
        the more, ‘Crucify him!’ So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the
        crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he
        handed him over to be crucified.</p>
        <h3 id="the-crowning-with-thorns">The Crowning with Thorns</h3>
        <p>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers
        wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed
        him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying, ‘Hail,
        King of the Jews!’ and striking him on the face. Pilate went out
        again and said to them, ‘Look, I am bringing him out to you to
        let you know that I find no case against him.’ So Jesus came
        out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate
        said to them, ‘Here is the man!’ When the chief priests and the
        police saw him, they shouted, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’ Pilate
        said to them, ‘Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no
        case against him.’ The Jews answered him, ‘We have a law, and
        according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to
        be the Son of God.’</p>
        <p>Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever.</p>
        <h3 id="the-carrying-of-the-cross">The Carrying of the
        Cross</h3>
        <p>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>
        <p>So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he
        went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in
        Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with
        him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them.
        Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It
        read, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.’ Many of the
        Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was
        crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in
        Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to
        Pilate, ‘Do not write, “The King of the Jews”, but, “This man
        said, I am King of the Jews.” ’ Pilate answered, ‘What I have
        written I have written.’</p>
        <h3 id="the-crucifixion">The Crucifixion</h3>
        <p>And that is what the soldiers did.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother,
        and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
        Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he
        loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, ‘Woman, here
        is your son.’ Then he said to the disciple, ‘Here is your
        mother.’ And from that hour the disciple took her into his own
        home.</p>
        <p>After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he
        said (in order to fulfil the scripture), ‘I am thirsty.’ A jar
        full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full
        of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When
        Jesus had received the wine, he said, ‘It is finished.’ Then he
        bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
        <h2 id="the-glorious-mysteries">The Glorious Mysteries</h2>
        <h3 id="the-resurrection">The Resurrection</h3>
        <p>After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning,
        Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. And
        suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord,
        descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat
        on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white
        as snow. For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead
        men. But the angel said to the women, ‘Do not be afraid; I know
        that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not
        here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place
        where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, “He has
        been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you
        to Galilee; there you will see him.” This is my message for
        you.’ So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and
        ran to tell his disciples.</p>
        <h3 id="the-ascension">The Ascension</h3>
        <p>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
        you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and
        Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.’ When he had said this,
        as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him
        out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up
        towards heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them.
        They said, ‘Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up towards
        heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven,
        will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.’</p>
        <h3
        id="the-descent-of-the-holy-spirit-on-mary-and-the-apostles">The
        Descent of the Holy Spirit on Mary and the Apostles</h3>
        <p>When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
        one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the
        rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where
        they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among
        them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were
        filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
        languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.</p>
        <p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven
        living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and
        was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the
        native language of each. Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and be
        baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that
        your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the
        Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you, for your children, and
        for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls
        to him.’ And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted
        them, saying, ‘Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.’ So
        those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about
        three thousand persons were added.</p>
        <h3 id="the-assumption">The Assumption</h3>
        <p>A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the
        sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of
        twelve stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth
        pangs, in the agony of giving birth. Then another portent
        appeared in heaven: a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten
        horns, and seven diadems on his heads.</p>
        <p>So when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the
        earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male
        child. But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle,
        so that she could fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to
        her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half
        a time. Then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a
        river after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood. But the
        earth came to the help of the woman; it opened its mouth and
        swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
        Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make
        war on the rest of her children, those who keep the commandments
        of God and hold the testimony of Jesus.</p>
        <p>Then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the
        seashore.</p>
        <h3 id="the-coronation">The Coronation</h3>
        <p>A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the
        sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of
        twelve stars. She was pregnant and was crying out in birth
        pangs, in the agony of giving birth. Then another portent
        appeared in heaven: a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten
        horns, and seven diadems on his heads. His tail swept down a
        third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. Then
        the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child,
        so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born. And
        she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the
        nations with a rod of iron. But her child was snatched away and
        taken to God and to his throne;</p>
